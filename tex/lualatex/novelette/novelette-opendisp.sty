%% OPENING PAGES
% Some portions of your book will begin with a reserved area, occupying perhaps
% one-fourth to one-half of the main text height. Main text does not begin
% until after the reserved area. The purpose is to create visual
% white space, so the reader knows this is different than what came before.
% New chapters, and some chapter-like portions, start this way.
%   Novelette uses the `opening' environment. Each opening begins a new page.
% If page design has a header, it will be empty above the opening.
%   Within the opening, material will have its own default alignment,
% rather than the full-textwidth justification of main text. The default
% in frontmatter and backmatter is centered. In mainmatter, it is a setting.
% This can be changed on a local basis.
%   When viewed with class option `shadelines', the background of the opening
% is palegray. The number of lines is set by height. The baseline of the
% topmost opening line is set by top. Note that the height and top are not
% enforced; they are only provided for visualization.
%   Within an opening environment, commands \name and \desc provide
% styled text. Ordinary text and images may also be used.

%% DISPLAY PAGES
% A "display page" ia a single page with style of its own, unrelated to
% anything else. Examples are Half-Title, Frontispiece, Title Page,
% Copyright Page, Dedication, Epigraph, and perhaps some others.
% Do not confuse a `display' with an `opening'.
%   Each display starts on a new page, and concludes with a new page.
% Note that TeX disregards multiple requests for a new page, unless there
% is something (even an intentional blank page) in between.
%   On a display page, all items are horizontally centered by default.
% There is no paragraph indent. There is a one-line gap between paragraphs.
% Header and footer will be empty. No footnotes are allowed.
