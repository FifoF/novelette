IMAGES AND ICONS

As of mid-March 2023, Novelette is in testing mode.

The \image command will be used to place images. It has been tested and works,
but more needs to be done.

Do not use images yet.


IMAGE COMMAND

Novelette does not use \includegraphics or any other standard TeX command
for image insertion. It uses a custom \image command, with or without star:
	\image[placement]{filename.png} % Image bottom at text baseline.
	\image*[placement]{filename.png} % Image bottom at text descender.

The placement may contain at most one of l,c,r, for horizontal alignment.
Default is c, except in the opening environment, where the default may be
set by the \openings command in Preamble.
	l -> left-aligned
	c -> horizontally centered
	r -> right-aligned

The placement may contain at most one of h,t,b, for insertion relative to
the flow of main text. These are "similar but different" to standard LaTeX
float definitions.
	h -> Place image "here" where the \image command is written, anywhere on
		the page. But if it cannot fit, move it to the top of the following
		page. Main text will flow to fill the lines left behind.
		If you do not wish text to flow, use \clearpage to break pages.
	t -> Place image at "top" of the page where command is written, which
		is usually above the command. In some cases, if the command is too
		late, or if other material is at the top, then the image is moved
		to the top of the following page.
	b -> Place image at "bottom" of the page where command is written.
		If it cannot fit there, place it at bottom of following page.
The \image command must occupy its own paragraph. If you need an inline image,
see the \emblem command.


EMBLEM COMMAND

A Novelette "emblem" is an inline image. Unlike an ordinary image, the
vertical height of an emblem is limited by the surrounding text size.
The maximum width is limited by the available width of wherever you place
the emblem. With care, you could use an emblem as a line by itself.
	\emblem{filename.png} % Bottom of emblem at text baseline.
	\emblem*{filename.png} % Bottom of emblem at text descender.
Without the star, an \emblem may not be taller than the height of Latin-1
uppercase letters with diacritical marks. With the star, an \emblem* may
be that height plus the descender height. These values are measured and
enforced.
	Since \emblem* can occupy as much height, above and below the baseline,
as the main font, it is a useful way to insert an unusual character as
an image. At 600 pixels/inch it will be almost as sharp as text.
Remember that Novelette is for print to paper, and thus does not benefit
from scalable vector graphics.
