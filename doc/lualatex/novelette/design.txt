DESIGN
	The \design command is used in Preamble. You may combine various settings
as comma-separated key=value pairs. Or, you may use \design more than once,
and let Novelette combine them.
	Anything you do not design, Novelette will design for you.

\design{fontsize=V}
	V is the main font size, integer|decimal with units pt or bp.
	Example: \design{fontsize=11.6pt}
	You do not set the leading (baselineskip). Novelette calculates it.
	Default V is based on printable width.
	Alternative: emperline.

\design{emperline=V}
	V is the integer|decimal number of font em per line of main text.
	Example: \design{emperline=28.74}
	Useful V is somewhere near 28. Depends on font, trim size, margins.
	Alternative: fontsize.
	Usually, emperline is only used when changing book dimensions.
	See Novelette documentation for explanation.

\design{lines=V}
	V is the integer number of lines in main body text (not header|footer).
	Example: \design{lines=32}
	Default V is based on main text height.

\design{style=V}
	V is integer 1-7. It selects header/footer style from a list.
	See Novelette documentation for the styles.
	Default V is based on page printable height.

\design{headgap=V}
	V is the integer|decimal gap between header and main text. Range 0-1.
	Ignored if design does not use a header.
	When V=0, the header is at the baseline immediately above main text.
	In most cases, V=0 does not look good.
	When V=1, an empty line is inserted between header and main text.
	Compromisee V=.5 may be satisfactory, especially for small trim sizes.
	Default V is based on page printable height.

\design{footgap=V}
	As with headgap, except applies between main text and footer.
	Ignored if design does not use a footer.
	If footgap is not set, then footgap=headgap.

\design{openings=V}
	V is one of: l c r o i.
	Aligns items in opening environment: left center right outside inside.
	Default V=c.

\design{footnotes=V}
	V is one or more of:  n l i
	Default footnotes use literary reference marks (asterisk, dagger, etc.).
	V=n changes them to numererical marks (1, 2, etc.).
	Default separator rule (line between main text and footnotes) is centered.
	V=l changes the rule to left alignment.
	Default footnotes do not indent at their beginning.
	V=i changes to indent, at same value as for main text.
	Whether or not V=i, multi-paragraph footnotes indent the extra paragraphs.
	Example: \design{footnotes=il}
