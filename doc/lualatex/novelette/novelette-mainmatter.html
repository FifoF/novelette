<h2>Main Matter</h2>
<p>Main Matter, or <i>mainmatter</i>, is your story. It includes chapters,
prologue, epilogue, maps, and so forth. It may include an Introduction,
if that is part of your story.</p>
<p>Mainmatter begins on recto Page 1. In most cases, that is where the
story's written text begins, regardless of whether it is a chapter or
something else. But there are exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have one or more maps on pages preceding the text, they are
mainmatter. By the time the reader arrives at the opening text, the page
is an odd number higher than 1.</li>
<li>If frontmatter is lengthy (don't do it), then it is customary to place
a second halftitle page as the beginning of mainmatter, page 1. The opening
text will have an odd page number, higher than 1.</li>
<li>If the story is divided into parts, Page 1 is the the display page
announcing Part I. The story text will begin on an odd page higher than 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mainmatter Commands</h3>
<p>This illustrates the most important commands used, from the start of
mainmatter. These start new chapters with an opening, and possibly divide
chapters into scenes.</p>
<p>Commands for local text styles (Italics, small caps, etc.) are
described <a href="novelette-textstyles.html">here</a>.
Commands for inserting images are <a href="novelette-images.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>\null</code> command inserts a blank line. May be repeated.
Actual mainmatter opening pages will often have many <code>\null</code> to
provide space at the top of the page, or between items on the page.</p>

</div>


<a id="memo"></id>
<div>
<h4><code>\memo{<i>Non-printing text.</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Novelette strongly discourages percent <code>%</code> for comments.
This is because % is a useful text character. If you forget to write
<code>\%</code> with the backslash, then the remainder of the text line does
not print. That may not be what you intended to do.</p>
<p>Instead, use the <code>\memo{}</code> command. Its content does not print.
The content may be multi-line. It may be quite lengthy.</p>
<p>The memo may not be mid-paragraph. It must stand by itself.</p>
</div>


<a id="mainmatter"></a>
<div>
<h4>\mainmatter</h4>
<p>The <code>\mainmatter</code> command defines the start of mainmatter.
It clears to a recto page. It re-starts page numbers at arabic 1. Whether
or not the page number is printed, depends on layout style.</p>
</div>


<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h4>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h4>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and can also be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">\desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>To vertically position items, use the <i>\null</i> command,
as often as necessary, to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>


<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h4>\name[option]{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h4>
<p>The \name command  may only be used
within the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number. This is not intended for more than
one line of text.</p>
<p>The name text is pre-set at 1.8 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>


<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h4>\desc[option]{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h4>
<p>The \desc command may only be used in an <a href="#opening">opening</a>
environment. If used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text. If necessary, you may use
\desc more than once, for multiple lines. However, multiple lines would
probably look better in ordinary main text.</p>
<p>The desc text is pre-set at 1.33 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>


<a id="init"></a>
<div>
<h4>\init[kern]{letter}{letters}</h4>
<p>The <code>\init</code> command is optional. But if you use it for one
chapter, you must uniformly use it for all of them.</p>
<p>It is customary to use something distinctive for the very first line
of chapter text. Drop caps are out of fashion, and never were widely used for
popular fiction, so Novelette does not do them.</p>
<p>The single <i>letter</i> argument is the first letter of the chapter text.
If text begins with quotation marks, you may include them. This letter will
be set larger than normal, so it is distinctive. It does not affect the
line grid.</p>
<p>The plural <i>letters</i> are letters, perhaps a few words, that will be
set with lowercase converted to small caps. Note that the <i>letter</i>
argument already placed a letter, so do not repeat it in <i>letters</i>.</p>
<p>After this, text is normal. Example:</p>
<p class="code">\init{I}{t was dark and stormy,} as usual there.</code></p>
<p>The optional <i>kern</i> will adjust the spacing between the enlarged
letter, and the following small caps letter. It is a number, without units.
Negative number moves them closer, positive farther. Rarely beyond -.2 to .2
range. Useful when the first letter is T, so you can move the following letter
partly under the overhang.</p>
<p>If you want the first letter to be something decorative, then you will
need to use <i>fontspec</i> syntax to define your own font command, and
use it there. Novelette will not do that for you; do it yourself.</p>
</div>


<a id="scene"></a>
<h4>\scene{<i>text</i>}</h4>
<p>The <code>\scene</code> command creates a scene break. If all you want is
a simple blank line, use <code>\null</code> instead.</p>
<p>The <i>text</i> has several variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>\scene{-} skips one line, and puts a long dash (about one-fourth width)
in the gap</li>
<li>\scene{*} skips one line, and puts three widely-spaced asterisks in
the gap.</li>
<li>\scene{text} (where text is neither - nor *) skips TWO lines, and puts the
text left-aligned in the gap. The text is slightly larger than main text.
It is off-grid, but this is visually best.</li>
<li>\scene{-text} (first character is hyphen) is like the above, except the
text begins with a long dash, with the first letter at indent. If your chapters
are routinely divided into scenes, this method is especially attractive.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a blank line instead of <code>\scene</code>, there may be pages
where the blank line is at top or bottom. Standard practice is to use
<code>\scene{-}</code> or <code>\scene{*}</code> to show that the missing line
was intentional.</p>
<p>In all cases, it is bad layout to have just one line above or below a
scene break. The only solution is to re-write.</p>  
</div>


<a id="footnotes"></a>
<div>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>Novelette is not intended for academic works. It only supports the kind of
footnote used by authors, to make a remark. These are known as "literary
style". The reference marks are symbols, not numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\footnote{Content of the footnote.}</code> places a reference mark
at the point in the main text, and writes the marked footnote at the bottom
of that page.</li>
<li><code>\footnotez{Content of the footnote.}</code> does not place a
reference mark, either in main text or at the footnote. This style is
sometimes used when a footnote applies to entire chapter, rather than to
any specific text. It is the only kind of footnote that may be attached
within an opening.</li>
</ul>
<p>The footnote is left-aligned (not indented), separated from main text
by a short line, and at slightly smaller text size. If a footnote continues
for more than one paragraph (don't do it!) then the additional paragraph
is indented.</p>
<p>Marked footnotes use symbols <code>* † ‡ §</code> (asterisk, dagger,
daggerdbl, section) then repeat as pairs <code>** †† ‡‡ §§</code>. If more
than 8 marked footnotes in a chapter, they re-start with asterisk. The cycle
is re-set to asterisk at each opening.</p>
<p>Pages with the display environment may not have footnotes.</p>
</div>


<a id="cleartoend"></a>
<div>
<h4>\cleartoend<br>
\end{document}</h4>
<p>When your story is finished, wrtie <code>\cleartoend</code> just prior to
<code>\end{document}</code>. This ensures that the PDF will have a final
blank verso page (as required by printers). If yor story ends recto, then
only one blamk page is added. If your story ends verso, then two blank pages
are added. This is calculated automatically.</p>
</div>


<a id="mainmatterexample"></a>
<div>
<h3>Example Main Matter</h3>
<p>The main matter of your book should look something like this:</p>
</div>


<div id="exampledoc" class="doctemplate">
