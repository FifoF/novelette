HEADERS AND FOOTERS

There are 7 different header/footer styles, chosen by number:
	\design{style=N}

N=1 : Only footer. Page number centered in footer.

N=2 : Header and footer. Page number centered in footer. Header contains
centered text.

N=3 : Header and footer. Page number at outside margin of footer.
Header text aligned to outside margin.

N=4 : Only header. Page number at outside margin. Text centered.

N=5 : Like 4, but with vertical bar near page number.

N=6 : Like 4, but with slash / next to page number.

N=7 : Header only. Both page number and text centered.
Page number closer to outside. Slash separates text from page number.

The default style depends on factors such as trim size, margins, and
lines per page. With enough vertical room, default N=2. With less
vertical room, default N=4.

Command \thispagestyle changes the style of an individual page:
	\thispagestyle{empty} : Blank header and footer.
	\thispagestyle{plain} : Blank header. Footer (if in style) appears.
Note that plain page style does not create a footer, if the style does
not ordinarily have one. Novelette does not have "drop folio".
This behavior is different from most other TeX document classes.

Opening pages automatically invoke \thispagestyle{plain}. Display pages
do not automatically invoke it; the choice is yours.
