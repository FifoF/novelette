<h2>Novelette - Documentation</h2>

<h4>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h4>


<p>Document class <i>novelette</i> is unlike any other LaTeX document class:
(a) It requires LuaLaTeX; (b) It does not honor widely-used LaTeX commands;
(c) It has its own methods for setting layout and other properties,
specifically written for those who have very little knowledge of LaTeX;
(d) The resulting PDF is created for printed (to paper) popular fiction,
such as detective novels, printed in black ink only; (e) There is no capability
for Ebooks or any kind of academic works.</p> 

<p>There are separate HTML pages for these topics:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>The <a href="novelette-preamble.html">Preamble</a> contains a small
number of required lines, plus settings of your choice. Novelette is
pre-configured for a common softcover print-on-demand format. Change as much
or as little as you wish.</li>
<li>In <a href="novelette-frontmatter.html">front matter</a> you will place
essential information about your book: title, copyright, and a few other pages.</li>
<li>The <a href="novelette-mainmatter.html">main matter</a> you place the
story itself, and possibly material (such as maps) that are part of the story.</li>
<li>Novelette is not intended for academic works. There is no special provision
for "backmatter" such as Appendix or Bibliography.</li>
</ul></p>
