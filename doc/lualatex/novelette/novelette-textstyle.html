<h2>Text Style Commands</h2>
<p class="noindent">In a work of popular fiction, there are not many text
styles. Novelette provides a reduced, custom command set, that does just
what you need. Most standard LaTeX commands are disabled, so if you are
reading some other documentation, it may be wrong for Novelette.</p>


<a id="basics"></a>
<div>
<h3>Reduced Command Set</h3>
<p>Other TeX document classes offer commands such as <code>\large</code>
for increasing the size of text, XXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>But Novelette has none of them. Either those commands are ignored,
or they will produce a warning or error, or not do what you expected
them to do. The reason is simple: None of them are very useful in a book
of popular fiction, and all of them would interact badly with the commands
that you really need.</p>
<p>This page describes the commands that Novelette provides, for styling
text. Without hacking the code, you cannot add packages that provide
more commands, because Novelette disables <code>\usepackage</code> and
<code>\RequirePackage</code>.</p>
</div>


<a id="blockindent"></a>
<div>
<h3>Block Indent</h3>
<p>You may indent one or more entire paragraphs:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\begin{blockindent}[<i>integer,integer</i>]<br>
Stuff to be indented.\par<br>
More stuff to be indented.\par</br>
\end{blockindent}
</code></p>
<p class="noindent">Without the optional argument, the block is left-indented
1 normal paragraph indent. With a single integer as optional argument,
the block is left-indented that many multiples or the normal indent.
With two comma-separated integers, indents are at left and right.</p>
<p>Within the block, the first line of each paragraph will be indented
relative to the block. If you wish, remove that indent by writing
<code>\noindent</code> or <code>\backindent</code> at the beginning of
the paragraph.</p>
</div>


<a id="tabline"></a>
<div>
<h3>Tab Lines</h3>
<p>Novelette does not have tables or two-column layout. However, you may
construct simple tables using the <code>\tabline</code> command. This is
suitable for a table of contents, or other lists with left and right text.</p>
<p>Use one or more <code>\tabline</code> within block indent:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\begin{blockindent}[L,R]<br>
\tabline[<i>option</i>]{<i>left item</i>}{<i>right item</i>}<br>
<i>additional tablines</i><br>
\end{blockindent}
</code></p>
<p class="noindent">The <i>left item</i> will be left-aligned at <i>L</i>
indents from left margin. The <i>right item</i> will be right-aligned at
<i>R</i> indents from right margin. Beteen them is a gap. If you want the gap
to be filled with a dotted line connecting the items, use
<code>\tabline*</code> with star.</p> 
<p>The <i>option</i> is any text. If used, it is probably a number, followed
by period. It will be placed to the left of the <i>left item</i>, separated
by space. Be sure that <i>L</i> is large enough to fit the optional text.
For example, L=1 is probably enough to fit a two-digit number with period.
But it will not be enough for uppercase Roman numerals. Novelette does not
adjust for insufficient space. It is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
{\centering CONTENTS\par}\null<br>
\begin{blockindent}[4,4]<br>
\tabline*[1.]{The House}{1}
\tabline*[2.]{The Ghost}{32}
\tabline{of Bibbleton Manor}{}
\tabline*[3.]{Frequent Screams}{53}
\end{blockindent}
</code></p>
<p class="noindent">Above, note how the second tabline was extended.
Alternatively, the second tabline could have been written without the star
and page number. Then, the star and page number would be at the extension.</p>
</div>


<a id="centering"></a>
<div>
<h3>Centering</h3>
<p>There are two methods for centering text. If the centered text has multiple
lines, but you do not want it to span the entire textwidth, then you must
manually break lines where needed. You may not center text within a
block indent.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{\centering Text of a centered paragraph\par}</code> may be used
when there is only one paragraph to be centered. Note the placement of
braces, and the use of <code>\par</code>. You may use <code>\\</code>
to break lines within the paragraph.</li>
<li><code>\begin{center} One or more paragraphs. \end{center}</code> creates
an environment, that centers everything within it.</li>
<li>Other TeX document classes add vertical space above and below centered
text. Novelette does not.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- ragged right, noindent, nohyphens, parskip -->


<a id="poetry"></a>
<div>
<h3>Poetry (Verse)</h3>
<p>Novelette does not have special commands for setting poems. Use block
indent, and <code>\noindent</code> each paragraph. Manually break lines,
using <code>\\</code>, and end each paragraph with <code>\par</code>.</p>
</div>



<h3>MORE TO COME</h3>


<!--

ITALICS
	\ital{Text in italics}
Includes trailing italic correction. May include more than one paragraph.


SMALL CAPS
	\smcp{Lowercase text in small caps}
Only uses real small caps, not faked. If your font does not have them,
then the result is ordinary text.
	\allsmcp{All included text in small caps}
Uses the smcp and c2sc features, if available in the font.


MEDIUM CAPS
	\medcap{TEXT} -or- \medcaps{TEXT}
Fakes "medium caps" at height between small caps and ordinary uppercase.
Useful for acronyms, where small caps are too small, uppercase too big.
Be sure that the TEXT is uppercase (lowercase will look bad).
	If the font does not have the `c2sc' OpenType feature, TEXT is unchanged.
If you need italics, use this order. Note the use of braces:
	\ital{\medcap{TEXT}}


\cleartorecto

\sups
\subs
\lnum

\liga
\dlig


%% START STEALING SHEEP
	\baa
If you write command \baa at the start of a paragraph, it will slightly
squeeze the text, just for that one paragraph. If you are lucky, a paragraph
with N lines and only a little text on the last line, may be squeezed down
to N-1 lines.
	\baa is the sound of a sheep. This is a typographic in-joke.
