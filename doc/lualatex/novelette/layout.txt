of header and/or footer from a menu of styles.

headgap

header and main text. Value 0 is rare. Value 1 is good for medium-large books.
Value 0.5 is compromise for small-medium books.

footgap
	As with headgap, except between main text and footer.

scale
	Number from 0.75 to 1. Scale of header/footer text, relative to main text.
