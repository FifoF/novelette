INTENT

This determines PDF/X-1a:2001 conformance.

PDF/X, particularly PDF/X-1a:2001, is a PDF format intended for the most
reliable exchange to a printing machine. The format requires that certain
things be in the PDF, and that other thing must not be in the PDF.

Your home or office printer does not need PDF/X, because its technology will
understand almost anything you provide. The result may or may not be exactly
what you wanted, but it will be good enough.

In the commercial printing world, "good enough" is not good enough.
The printer will not guess what you mean. It will not take time to analyze
ambiguous PDF instructions. It will require precise definition of colors
according to printing technology standards (this does not apply to you).
Some print services will reject a PDF unless it conforms to PDF/X.
A non-conforming PDF is not necessarily defective, so some other print
services will accept it.

Novelette allows you to choose among several widely-used PDF/X-1a:2001
output intent. An output intent is your declaration that your color definitions
agree with the capabilites of a particular print technology. This is actually
irrelevant to a black/white book interior, but it is part of the standard.

If you choose intent none, your PDF will not be PDF/X. If you are in draft
mode, it is always intent none, no matter what your setting. The only
advantage to intent none, is that some inspections are not performed
udring build, so your document builds faster.

\intent{none}
	-> Not PDF/X conformant.
	-> Uses PDF /Info instead of XMP metadata.
	-> Does not rigorously examine images.
	-> Automatically used in draft mode, regardless of user setting.

\intent{SWOP}
	-> PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant.
	-> Uses XMP metadata with US Web Coated SWOP output intent.
	-> Only applied in final mode.
	-> Rigorously examines images.

\intent{FOGRA39}
	-> PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant.
	-> Uses XMP metadata with FOGRA39 output intent.
	-> Only applied in final mode.
	-> Rigorously examines images.

\intent{JC200103}
	-> PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant.
	-> Uses XMP metadata with JC200203 output intent.
	-> Only applied in final mode.
	-> Rigorously examines images.

\intent{custom}
	-> PDF/X-1a:2001 conformant, if your code is good.
	-> Uses XMP metadata with do-it-yourself output intent.
	-> Requires user-provided definitions.
	-> Only applied in final mode.
	-> Rigorously examines images.
