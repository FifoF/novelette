<h3>What is mainmatter ?</h3>
<p>Main matter, or mainmatter, is your story. If something is "about the book"
rather than part of the story, then it does not belong in mainmatter.</p>
<p>Chapters are part of the story. So is a Prologue. If you have a map of a
fictional world, or a diagram of the murder scene, it is part of the story,
so it belongs in mainmatter.</p>
<p>What about an Introduction? Novelette is intended for popular fiction,
where frontmatter is short. If you have something to say (as author), put it
in frontmatter, as a one or two page Author's Note.</p>
<p>If an Introduction is part of the story, then it belongs in mainmatter.
This might be the case in the "lost manuscript" genre, in which a fictional
Introduction is by a fictional archaeologist, who explains how the manuscript
was discovered. The rest of the story, beginning with Chapter 1, is the
fictional manuscript.</p>
</div>


<a id="mainwhere"></a>
<div>
<h3>Where is Page 1 ?</h3>
<p>Page 1, arabic numerals, is the first page of mainmatter. It is always
recto. In most cases, it is the start of your story text: Chapter 1,
or Prologue, or fictional Introduction.</p>
<p>But if you place a map prior to the start of story text, then the start
of story text must be Page 3 or more (always odd). This is because the map is
part of mainmatter. Page 1 may be the map, or it may be a repeat of the
half-title. It may say Part I, for a multi-part book. It may be an Epigraph,
but only if the Epigraph is part of the story (not from an external source
such as Shakespeare).</p>
<p>When frontmatter is lengthy (don't do it), it is customary to repeat
the half-title as Page 1, so the story begins on Page 3.</p>
</div>


<a id="mainmatter"></a>
<div>
<h3>\mainmatter</h3>
<p>The <code>\mainmatter</code> command defines the start of mainmatter.
It clears to a recto page. It re-starts page numbers at arabic 1. Whether
or not the page number is printed, depends on layout style.</p>
</div>


<a id="headtext"></a>
<div>
<h3>\versohead{<i>content</i>} -and- \rectohead{<i>content</i>}</h3>
<p>Commands <code>\versohead{}</code> and <code>\rectohead{}</code> apply
when the layout style has a header. Otherwise, they are ignored.</p>
<p>These commands have no effect in frontmatter. In mainmatter, they define
the content of verso and recto header text. Page numbering is automatic,
so it is not affected by these commands.</p>
<p>You may repeat the commands throughout the book. For example, perhaps
you wish to put the chapter number in the header. But be aware that most
print-on-demand services require that headers contain only the book title
and author name, exactly as they are registered with the distribution network.
So, it is better to keep the same headers throughout the book.</p>
<p>The headers may be styled, using commands for small caps or italics.
If you do not use these commands to define your own headers, then Novelette
will automatically put the title in all-small caps above verso pages, and
the author in Italics above recto pages.</p>
<p>Opening pages never display a header.</p>
</div>


<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h3>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and can also be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">\desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>To vertically position items, use the <i>\null</i> command,
as often as necessary, to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>


<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name[option]{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h3>
<p>The \name command  may only be used
within the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number. This is not intended for more than
one line of text.</p>
<p>The name text is pre-set at 1.8 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>


<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\desc[option]{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h3>
<p>The \desc command may only be used in an <a href="#opening">opening</a>
environment. If used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text. If necessary, you may use
\desc more than once, for multiple lines. However, multiple lines would
probably look better in ordinary main text.</p>
<p>The desc text is pre-set at 1.33 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
