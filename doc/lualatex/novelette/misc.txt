MISCELLANEOUS


ITALICS
	\ital{Text in italics}
Includes trailing italic correction. May include more than one paragraph.


SMALL CAPS
	\smcp{Lowercase text in small caps}
Only uses real small caps, not faked. If your font does not have them,
then the result is ordinary text.
	\allsmcp{All included text in small caps}
Uses the smcp and c2sc features, if available in the font.


MEDIUM CAPS
	\medcap{TEXT} -or- \medcaps{TEXT}
Fakes "medium caps" at height between small caps and ordinary uppercase.
Useful for acronyms, where small caps are too small, uppercase too big.
Be sure that the TEXT is uppercase (lowercase will look bad).
	If the font does not have the `c2sc' OpenType feature, TEXT is unchanged.
If you need italics, use this order. Note the use of braces:
	\ital{\medcap{TEXT}}
