Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress, as of late February 2023. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change. Thus, no documentation yet.
Power users can get a glimpse of what Novelette will do, by looking into
the code.

Expected release late March 2023.
