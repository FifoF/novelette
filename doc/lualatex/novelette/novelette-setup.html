<h2>Setup</h2>


<a id="basics"></id>
<div>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Novelette requires a working TeX installation with LuaTeX and LaTeX.
It does not require much else.</p>
<p>When you install TeXlive (or MiKTeX), you need these collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential programs and files</li>
<li>LaTeX fundamental packages</li>
<li>LuaTeX packages</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a very small installation, in the TeX world. You will also need
these packages, which you may already have:</p>
<p class="code"><code>xparse xpatch xifthen xstring ifmtarg fontspec<br>
fp microtype silence changepage noindentafter</code></p>
<p>You will need hyphenation patterns for the language you will write
(you do not need them for the occasional short phrase in another language).
If you did not install the TeXlive collection for your language, you may
install only what you need. In most cases, you need package
<code>hyphen-yourlang</code> where <i>yourlang</i> is the English lowercase
name of your language (french, not françcais; italian, not italiano).
Disregard regional differences: canadien, suisse, français are all french.</p>
<p>Unless you are an advanced user who writes custom code, you do not need
to read the documentation for packages other than Novelette itself. If you
are an advanced user, you probably need the documentation for packages
<code>fontspec</code> and <code>microtype</code>.</p>
<p>In some Linux operating systems, there is no <code>lualatex</code> binary
program. Check: <code>which lualatex</code>. If it is not found, try this:
<code>which luahbtex</code>. If that is not found, then your TeX installation
is bad. Otherwise, navigate to the directory that has <code>luahbtex</code>
and command: <code>ln -s luahbtex lualatex</code></p>
</div>


<a id="yourfonts"></id>
<div>
<h3>Your Fonts</h3>
<p>Do not rely on the default fonts that come with a basic TeX installation.
In general, they are not suited to popular fiction.</p>
<p>Novelette can use any OpenType font (extension <code>otf</code>)
and some TrueType fonts (extension <code>ttf</code>). It cannot use Type 1
fonts (extension <code>pfb</code>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/">LaTeX Font Catalog</a> shows
samples of all fonts that can be installed within TeX. If you like a font,
be sure that it is available as OpenType (or TrueType).</p>
<p>You are not limited to LaTeX fonts. On most platforms, Novelette can find
fonts installed in the operating system, not just the ones installed by TeX.
So, if you have a free/shareware/commercial font that you like, and can
install it in your operating system, Novelette can use it.</p>
</div>


<a id="fontlicenses"></a>
<div>
<h3>Font Licenses</h3>
<p>Whether you use a LaTeX font, or a font that comes with your operating
system, or a font that came with some program, or a font that you installed
from any other source: <i>Be sure that the font has a license that permits
embedding, for printed books, for profit.</i> This is your responsibility;
Novelette cannot check it.</p>
<p>Many "free" or system fonts do not have a suitable license.
In particular, DO NOT use any font that comes with the "GNU Public License"
(GPL) unless it also has a "font exception" clause that allows embedding
for any purpose. Some fonts have a free version, and a paid version.
You might need the paid version.</p>
<p>In general, fonts with the LPPL (LaTeX Project Public License), or
MIT License, or SIL OFL (Open Font License), can be used.</p>
</div>


<a id="fontpreviews"></a>
<div>
<h3>Font Previews</h3>
<p>Your print-on-demand book will be printed using a high-speed photocopier,
not offset press (unless you strike it rich). Before committing to a font,
create test files, for each <i>Font Name</i>.</p>
<p>Use the following code. Select either <i>letter</i> or <i>A4</i> depending
on what size paper is used. This is not the same as your book page size:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\title{Font Test File}<br>
\author{Novelette}<br>
\setfont{main}{<i>Font Name</i>}<br>
\sheetfeed{<i>letter or A4</i>}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
\fillertext<br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>Print the PDF on a photocopier that can print directly from digital files.
Where I live, this kind of machine is often at print/ship services. Be sure
to specify non-color print.</p>
<p>The name of the main font will be printed above the filler text. That way,
you can print several test files, and know which font is which.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to how dark the characters print. Fonts intended
for offset presses may print too light. Pay attention to the reading
experience: Does the text flow the way you expect in fiction, or does it look
more like a textbook?</p>
<p>Only <i>you</i> can decide.</p>
</div>


<a id="altfont"></a>
<div>
<h3>Alternate Font</h3>
<p>Some very nice OpenType and TrueType fonts do not have an extended
character set. Usually, that is no problem. If you are writing in one
of the major Western European languages, almost any font has what you need.</p>
<p>But what if you need the occasional character that is not in your chosen
font? Novelette provides <code>\altfont{<i>character</i>}</code> for this
purpose. The <i>character</i> is picked from font <i>Libertinus Serif</i>,
scaled to match surrounding lowercase text.</p>
<p>For that to work properly, you must have <i>Libertinus Serif</i> fonts
installed where TeX can find them. You only need the fonts, not support
for math or anything else. Command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>tlmgr install libertinus-fonts</code></p>
<p>Why <i>Libertinus Serif</i>? It has moderate design that will be
inconspicuous when you insert the occasional character. It has a large
character set, with many OpenType Features. In fact, it is worth consideration
as your main font.</p>
<p>If you do not use <code>\altfont</code>, then it does not matter.
But if you use <code>\altfont</code> and <i>Libertinus Serif</i> is not
installed, then Novelette will issue a warning, use
<i>Latin Modern Roman</i> there, and prevent final mode.</p>
