Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change.

Update: April 26, 2023: Almost ready for beta testing. At this point,
the command set is reasonably stable. Might do some
under-the-hood modifications, or not. Working on the documentation,
so there are places where the docs are incomplete or incorrect.
Testing welcome!
