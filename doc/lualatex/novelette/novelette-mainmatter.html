<h2>Novelette - Design and Content of Main Matter</h2>

<h4>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h4>

<a id="mainwhat"></a>
<h3>What is mainmatter ?</h3>
<p>Main matter, or mainmatter, is your story. It includes chapters, and
may contain other things. If something is "about the book" rather than
part of the story, then it does not belong in mainmatter.</p>
<p>The beginning of mainmatter is signaled by the <i>\mainmatter</i> command.
This ensures that the next page will be recto, and changes the style and numbering
of printable page numbers.</p>
<p>In many cases, page 1 will be the very first page of your story. Whether it
is named Chapter 1, or Introduction, or Prologue, does not matter.</p>
<p>In other cases, page 1 will be earlier, so that the text of your story
begins on page 3 or later. These cases are:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Lengthy frontmatter (exceeding 8 pages). The visual separator will be
page 1.</li>
<li>Story is divided into Parts. In this case, the Part I page is page 1.</li>
<li>Maps or diagrams, relevant to the story, are placed prior to the text.
In this case, the visual separator is page 1, followed by the maps, then
the text.</li> 
</ul></p>
<p>No matter what is there, page 1 is always recto, and the first page of
the text (whether or not it is page 1) is always recto.</p>
</div>

<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h3>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and can also be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">\desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>To vertically position items, use the <i>\null</i> command,
as often as necessary, to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>

<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name[option]{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h3>
<p>The \name command  may only be used
within the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number. This is not intended for more than
one line of text.</p>
<p>The name text is pre-set at 1.8 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>

<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\desc[option]{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h3>
<p>The \desc command may only be used in an <a href="#opening">opening</a>
environment. If used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text. If necessary, you may use
\desc more than once, for multiple lines. However, multiple lines would
probably look better in ordinary main text.</p>
<p>The desc text is pre-set at 1.33 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
