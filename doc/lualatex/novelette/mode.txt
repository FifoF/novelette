MODE

\mode{draft}
	-> Each page has MODE:DRAFT written at upper left.
	-> Document title is changed to DRAFT - jobname.
	-> PDF will not have XMP metadata.
	-> PDF will not be PDF/X

\mode{shade}
	-> Each page has MODE:SHADE written at upper left.
	-> Automatically invokes draft mode. No XMP, no PDF/X.
	-> Margins are shaded gray.

\mode{align}
	-> Each page has MODE:ALIGN written at upper left.
	-> Automatically invokes draft and shade modes. No XMP, no PDF/X.
	-> Gray lines at each text baseline.

\mode{final}
	-> Provides XMP metadata nd PDF/X, if requested by \intent.
	-> Refused by Novelette, under some circumstances. See below.

Special circumstances:
	If Novelette detects an error or warning when you request final mode,
it will automatically switch to draft mode, and will not write PDF/X or
XMP metadata. Instead it will write /Info metadata, if processing finishes.
	However, the switch will probably occur after some pages were already
processed, so the DRAFT label will not appear at page upper left.
Still, the PDF internal title will have DRAFT.
