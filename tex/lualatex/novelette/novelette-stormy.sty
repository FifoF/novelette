\long\def\darkandstormy{

Darkness and storminess are an important part of this story.
As he rode through the darkness, Lord Withens thought to himself,
``My, this night is very stormy.''

But the darkness and storminess would be just the beginning of his troubles.
His destination was the castle of Lady Withens, who was rather pleasant,
but a book like this needs trouble somewhere along the line, eh? It also
needs a car chase near the ending, if the author has any hopes of this
becoming a major motion picture. Don't worry, the car chase comes later.

At this point is must be noted that Lord Withens was married to Lady
Withens, and Lady Withens was married to Lord Withens. But they were not
the same lords and ladies. You see, Withenshire was a rather remote area,
where over the course of centuries everyone was everyone else's relative,
to a greater or lesser degree, most of them were named Withens, and most
of them were lords or ladies. So, if you have been following closely,
by now you realize that this particular lord was cheating on his lady,
and this particular lady was cheating on her lord.

Without that kind of complication, we wouldn't have much of a story,
now would we? At any rate, all the lords and ladies drove very expensive
sports cars, so we can look forward to one heck of a chase scene.

Also, the Withenshire pronunciation of ``TeX'' rhymes with ``sex,'' which
is necessary for best-selling books these days. So if you stick around to
chapter forty-two, there will be plenty of it. Between now and then, our story
will be limited to gratuitious violence, which is necessary for the movie.
And if you wondered why this text has forty-two instead of 42, it is only
a matter of custom. Even the Withens know how to read numbers.
Well, most of them do.

``Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?'' cried Lady Withens.

She was drunk, of course. Almost everyone in Withensire was drunk, most of
the time. Don't worry, they will all be sober for the car chase scene.
Wouldn't want to set a bad example for young readers, or viewers, now would we?

``My name is not Romeo,'' replied Lord Withens.

Actually, there was a Romeo Withens somewhere in the vicinity.
He was not the husband of this Lady, either.
But this Lord did not know that. He did not know much of anything. He was,
to put this delicately, a bit short of apps on his smartphone.

If you are anxious to flip ahead to the naughty stuff, and wonder why there
are forty-one awful chapters before it, calm down. There is a lot of money to
be made in animation. Some of the chapters will feature talking rodents
and flying donkeys. You were young once, weren't you? And you watched cartoons,
didn't you? So there! Besides, hardly anyone reads much, nowadays.
And cartoons have been violent for decades, so that is not a problem.

``Yea, verily, I am losing patience with all this purple prose,'' screamed
Lady Withens. ``Is there no good writer to be found anywhere in this shire?
Or am I condemned to reading filler material that has no chance of ever
becoming the plot of a major motion picture? Or, as a a last resort, must I
flip through five hundred cable channels?''

Suddenly, there was a flash of lighning, and a roll of thunder, which often
accompanies lightning, especially when the night is dark and stormy.
Written in the clouds was this dire message:

{\centering\textit{\_\_cthulhu\_fthagn}\par}

Owls screeched, horses whinnied, and whatever other sound effects are needed.
Lord Withens trembled in fear. He knew that the message in the clouds was
written in \textit{expl3} syntax. But after a few moments, he calmed down.
Earlier that day, an itinerant preacher had told him to beware the handwriting
on the wall. But this was in the clouds, so that was all right.
