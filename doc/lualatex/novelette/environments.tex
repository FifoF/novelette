ENVIRONMENTS

If you have used LaTeX before, you know that there are a number of pre-defined
"environments" common to all LaTeX, an additional number that are added by
various packages, and others you may define yourself.

Forget all of that.

Novelette only has a small number of environments that you may use.
Mos of the pre-existing environments have been re-defined so that they throw
an error.

Here are the ONLY environments you may use in Novelette:
	document (required)
	center
	blockindent
	display
	opening

Looking for table, list, math, picture, figure, minipage ?
They do no exist in Novelette.

There are two reasons why this is so:
	1. For popular fiction, the available environments are all you need.
	2. Most environment introduce layout that is incompatible with Novelette.
