SCENE BREAKS

\scene{argument}

The argument is mandatory. If necessary, use empty braces {}.

If the argument is space or empty, \scene{} simply inserts a blank line.

If the argument is a hyphen (without additional text), \scene{-}
skips a line, and  places a short centered line in the gap.

If the argument is an asterisk (without additional text), \scene{*}
skips a line, and places three widely-spaced asterisks in the gap.

If the argument is anything else, TWO lines are skipped. The argument
is placed in the gap. It is unindented, slightly larger than normal text,
and slightly raised from the second baseline (so it is off-grid, by design).

If the argument text begins with one hyphen, then a dash precedes the
remaining text. The dash is at half lowercase x-height.
	\scene{-IX. The Dinner}

If the argument text begins with a single plus sign, then a dash precedes the
remaining text. The dash is at half uppercase X-height.
	\scene{+IX. The Dinner}

The text may be styled with Italics. Note the use of \itshape here:
	\scene{+IX. \itshape{The Dinner}}

In all cases, the following paragraph is not indented.

As a matter of style, if an otherwise-blank scenebreak occurs at the first or
last line of a page, change it to a non-blank form.

As a matter of style, it looks bad if a page has just one line above or
beneath a scenebreak. The only solution is to re-write (more or less text).
