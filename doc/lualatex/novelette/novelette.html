<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Novelette is a lualatex document class, specifically intended for
popular fiction, especially using print-on-demand TO PAPER technology.
It has no capability for Ebooks, and never will. It has no capability
for color or grayscale. Black ink only! Line art images OK, but they
must be raster PNG format.</p>

<p>Unlike most other document classes, Novelette is pre-configured for
the most frequently used size and style of P.O.D. popular fiction.
If they is not what you need, the various settings have understandable
names and values.</p>

<p>There are not a lot of possible settings. There are not a lot of possible
automations. Novelette keeps you focused on writing your book,
not on difficult TeX code.</p>

<p>And ... [pause for dramatic effect] ... Novelette does not have math.
You weren't going to put math in your fiction book, were you?</p>

<p>The earlier <i>Novel</i> document class has much more capability
than is really needed, and thus has a learning curve. The <i>Novelette</i>
class has only what is necessary to produce every murder mystery, sci-fi, and
adventure novel that I see on the public library shelves. You would be
amazed at how little is needed, and how easy it is to learn (if you already
have a working TeX system).</p>

<p>Be aware that Novelette does not honor many widely-used LaTeX commands.
You will not get much help (and get wrong advice) from standard references
or online resources.</p>

<p>There are separate HTML pages for these topics:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>The <a href="novelette-preamble.html">Preamble</a> contains a small
number of required lines, plus settings of your choice. Novelette is
pre-configured for a common softcover print-on-demand format. Change as much
or as little as you wish.</li>
<li>In <a href="novelette-frontmatter.html">front matter</a> you will place
essential information about your book: title, copyright, and a few other pages.</li>
<li>The <a href="novelette-mainmatter.html">main matter</a> you place the
story itself, and possibly material (such as maps) that are part of the story.</li>
<li>Novelette is not intended for academic works. There is no special provision
for "backmatter" such as Appendix or Bibliography.</li>
</ul></p>
