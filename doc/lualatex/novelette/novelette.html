<h2>Novelette - Documentation</h2>

<p>Document class <i>novelette</i> is designed for one purpose only: popular fiction,
printed to paper (not Ebooks), black ink, especially using print-on-demand technology.
It has what is necessary for that purpose, and no more. Much of the vast LaTeX code
is disabled or ignored. The result is a small set of commands that have simple names
and simple usage. They do what you need, allowing you to focus on writing your book,
instead of manipulating LaTeX code.</p>

<p>Here is a model document template. Each of its commands is a hyperlink within
this documentation. Click to learn what the commands do, and how to choose their values:</p>

</div>


<a id="lualatex">
<div>
<h3>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". Some GUI programs (TeXworks, TeXstudio, etc.)
can read this line. It tells them to use <i>lualatex</i> compiler, regardless
of what the program uses for its standard compiler.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, be sure to use </i>lualatex</i>.
Anything else will be rejected.</p>
</div>

<a id="utf-8">
<div>
<h3>% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". It tells some GUI programs that the characters
have utf-8 encoding. You must type your document using utf-8, without its
"byte order mark" (BOM). This is essential. It is the default encoding for
Linux and Mac. On Windows, be sure to tell configure text editor for
utf-8 without BOM.</p>
</div>

<a id="documentclass">
<div>
<h3>\documentclass{novelette}</h3>
<p>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette has no class options.
Anything you need is set by one of the other commands in Preamble,
or is automatically calculated from other settings.</p>
</div>

<a id="mode">
<div>
<h3>\mode{<i>choose</i>}</h3>
<p>Novelette has four modes: draft, shade, align, final. If you do not set
the mode, its default is draft.</p>
<p><b>draft</b> disables PDF/X conformance (see <a href="#intent">intent</a>).
It places DRAFT at the top left of each page. The PDF title is changed,
to include the word DRAFT.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the layout, line breaks, and page breaks are the same as they
will be, when you graduate to final mode.</p>
<p><b>shade</b> is draft mode, with margins tinted gray.</p>
<p><b>align</b> is draft mode, with margins tinted gray, and with text baselines marked.</p>
<p><b>final</b> should only be used when you are ready. In final mode, Novelette
performs some checks that it would otherwise omit (to save time). If your document
fails one of the checks, you will be warned. It will automatically revert to draft mode,
so that the PDF cannot be confused with the final file.</p>
</div>

<a id="intent">
<div>
<h3>\intent{<i>choose</i>}</h3>
<p>There are five intents: none, SWOP, FOGRA, JC, custom. The default is none.</p>
<p>No matter which intent you choose, fonts are subset embedded. That is enough
for some print services. But many print services require PDF/X conformance,
especially <span style="white-space:nowrap">PDF/X-1a:2001.</span></p>
<p>When a PDF file conforms to PDF/X, it must have a certain internal structure.
Among the requirements is an "output intent", which states that the PDF was prepared
according to the requirements of a particular print technology. It does not force
the printer to use that technology. In fact, your file will be printed by
entirely different methods. Nevertheless, an intent must be declared, even
though it is useless.</p>
<p>You are strongly urged to use an intent, other than <i>none</i>, for the final PDF.
This enables additional checks, hopefully reducing the possibility that your
file will be rejected by the print service.</p>
<p><b>none</b> does not produce PDF/X. No matter how you set intent,
it will be automatically changed to <i>none</i> unless you are in final mode.</p>
<p><b>SWOP</b> means "US Web Coated SWOP". This is most frequently used in
the United States.</p>
<p><b>FOGRA</b> means "FOGRA39L". This is frequently used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>JC</b> means "JC200103". This is frequently used in Japan.</p>
<p><b>custom</b> means that you will provide the data for some other intent.
You must code the data yourself. Do not use <i>custom</i> unless specifically required
by your print service.</p>
</div>

<a id="trimsize">
<div>
<h3>\trimsize{width=<i>W</i>,height=<i>H</i>}</h3>
<p>Trim Size is the size of your book pages. Be sure to choose cream paper
(creme, off-white), not white paper. The print service will offer a choice
of several standard sizes.</p>
<p>Dimensions <i>W</i> and <i>H</i> are measured in units of inches or
millimeters (in,mm).<p>
<p>The name "trim size" comes from the manufacturing process. Softcover books,
especially print-on-demand, are usually printed using Perfect Print technology.
The pages are printed on larger paper, roughly cut and assembled with glue,
the cover is attached with glue, then the entire book is "trimmed" with
a cutting device. This is why Perfect Print books have all page edges aligned.</p>
<p>In the case of library hardcover books, trim size refers to the interior
pages. The cover size is slightly larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="sheetfeed">
<div>
<h3>\sheetfeed{<i>choose</i>}</h3>
<p>Do not use the \sheetfeed setting, unless you are certain that you need it.
If you use this setting incorrectly, big problems will result.
Available choices are trimsize, letter, A4.</p>
<p><b>trimsize</b> is the default. The PDF page size will be the same as
the book trim size. This is how nearly all print-on-demand services want it.</p>
<p><b>letter</b> forces the PDF page size to USletter, 8.5in width, 11in height.
The book trim size is centered vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p><b>A4</b> (or a4) forces the PDF page size to European A4, 210mm width,
297mm height. The book trim size is cenetered vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p>If you are printing pages at home, for manual editing, then you might
use letter or A4, to produce a consistent result from your home printer.
That might also be the case, if your book will be reviewed by an editor.</p>
<p>Novelette does not produce crop marks or trim marks. It does write the
internal "TrimBox" metadata to the PDF.</p>
</div>

<a id="margins">
<div>
<h3>\margins{top=<i>T</i>,outside=<i>O</i>,bottom=<i>B</i>,inside=<i>I</i>}</h3>
<p>In Novelette, margins surround the printable area. Nothing may be printed
within the margins. The header, main text, and footer all must fit within the
rectangle surrounded by the margins. This is how the term "margins" is used
by most print services.</p>
<p>Word processors usually place header within the top margin, and footer
within the bottom margin. You cannot do that in Novelette.</p>
<p>Margins are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm). It is best
to use the same units for margins, as you use for trim size.</p>
<p><b>top</b> margin is the area above the topmost printable item, which
is the header (if your page style uses header), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>outside</b> margin is the area at the outer page edge, being the left
side of even-numbered (verso) pages, or the right side of odd-numbered (recto)
pages.</p>
<p><b>bottom</b> margin is the area below the lowest printable item, which
is the footer (if your page layout uses footer), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>inside</b> margin as at the spine (binding). In general, this margin
should be set 0.125in (or 3mm) wider than the ouside margin. The extra width
allows for binding glue.</p>
<p>You may abbreviate the margins setting, with a single value:<br>
\margins{<i>size</i>} sets top, ouside, and bottom margins to that size.
Inside margin is set 0.125in (or 3mm) larger.</p>
<p>If you do not set margins, Novelette will set them for you. At smaller
trim sizes, the margins will be at the minimum required by print services.
At larger trim size, the margins will be larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="design">
<div>
<h3>\design</a>{chars=<i>C</i>,lines=<i>L</i>,style=<i>S</i>,headgap=<i>H</i>,footgap=<i>F</i>}</h3>
<p>This setting determines page layout. In Novelette, you do not set either the
font size, or the leading (baselineskip). Instead, they are automatically
calculated from the trim size, margins, and design.</p>
<p><b>chars</b> is the typical average number of characters (including spaces) per line of main text.
More characters means that more text fits on each line. This is achieved by reducing
the font size to fit. The default value for C is 62 for small to medium trim sizes,
larger for large trim sizes.</p>
<p>The value is not precise, and it is only an average. It assumes that the font you use,
and your style of writing, is "typical" for popular fiction. Do a few test pages,
to see what value of C works best.</p>
<p><b>lines</b>is the ineger number of lines in the main text block.
It does not count header or footer. Default value varies, based on other setings.</p>
<p><b>style</b> is an integer from 1 to 7. It determines whether page layout has
header and/or footer, and determines alignment of header content. Other document classes
require you to write code for the style. Novelette does that for you.</p>
<p>The default style depends on how much vertical room is available, based on
other settings. If enough room, style 2 is default. If not enough room, style 4.</p>
<p><b>style=1</b> provides only footer. Page number centered in footer.</p>
<p><b>style=2</b> provides both header and footer. Page number centered in footer.
Text cenetered in header.</p>
<p><b>style=3</b> provides both header and footer. Page number in footer,
aligned to outside margin. Text in header aligned to outside margin.</p>
<p><b>style=4</b> provides only header. Page number at outside margin.
Text cenetered.</p>
<p><b>style=5</b> is like 4. Adds a vertical bar near the page number, at fixed
distance from the outside margin.</p>
<p><b>style=6</b> is like 4. Adds a slash next to the page number.</p>
<p><b>style=7</b> provides only header. Page number and text are centered,
separated by slash. Page number is toward the outside.</p>
<p><b>headgap</b> is a number (integer or decimal) from 0 to 1. It defines
how much of a "gap" appears between the header and the top of main text.
Value 0 is rarely useful. Value 1 skips a whole line, and is best for the
large book sizes. Value 0.5 is a nice compromise for smaller books.</p>
<p><b>footgap</b> works like headgap, except it applies between main text
and footer.</p>
<p>If your design has both header and footer, it is best to set headgap and
footgap at the same value. But this is not requird.</p> 
</div>

<a id="setfont">
<div>
<h3>\setfont{<i>role</i>}{<i>font name</i>}[<i>features</i>]</h3>
<p>Novelette uses <i>fontspec</i> technology for Open Type fonts. If you are
a knowledgeable LaTeX user, you may use some aspects of <i>fontspec</i>
directly. However, do not use <i>\setmainfont</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>\setfont</i> command has two mandatory arguments, and an optional argument.</p>
<p><b>role</b> is one of these keywords: <i>main head note name desc deco alt</i>.
It assigns the font to its proper place and purpose.</p>
<p><b>font name</b> is the Open Type font family name. Examples are Swainson,
EB Garamond, Libertinus Serif. You cannot use TeX fonts (which use three-letter codes).</p>
<p><b>features</b> is an optional, comma-separated list of Open Type features, using
<i>fontspec</i> syntax.</p>
<p><b>main</b> role is equivlanet to <i>\setmainfont</i>. The font and features
will be used for main body text.</p>
<p><b>head</b> is applied to only the header and footer. In many cases,
this is the same as the main font, except do not use ligatures. You might
prefer to use Scale=N where N is a number slightly less than 1.</p>
<p><b>note</b> is used for footnotes and "legalese" text. It is almost always
the same as main font, except with Scale less than 1.</p>
<p><b>name</b> is the font used by the opening <i>\name</i> command. It may be the
same as the main font, but at larger Scale. Or you may use a stylish font.</p>
<p><b>desc</b> is the font used by the opening <i>\desc</i> command. It is usually
the same as the main font, but at larger Scale.</p>
