Swainson Fonts Info

Currently, this directory contains plain text files, in the FontForge *.sfd format, but with extension re-named as *txt.

The developer is still working on these. Not even close to finished.

The files are provided for backup purposes. When the fonts are finished,
these files will be replaced by their *otf fonts.

The Regular and Italic fonts exist. Probably there will be a Light (regular) as well, for titling.
Be there will not be Bold or Bold Italic added. There is no need for bold in popular literature,
which is the purpose of these fonts.

These fonts only include the Western European character set (Latin-1) plus
a few other characters, and typographic characters such as curly quotes.
They will never be extended to a much larger character set, because there are
already many fonts for that purpose. The main reason for having these fonts is
to provide a few reference glyphs that other fonts may not have.

Originally (two years ago!) these fonts were intended as a private (me only) derivative of some Libertinus Serif fonts.
But in the intervening time, they morphed into originals, with no code from Libertinus Serif.
The finished Swainson fonts will be closer to Garamond styles.
Nevetheless, the designers of Libertinus Serif deserve credit for providing something to view as glyph models.

About the font name: While I was working on these, a seasonal songbird pecked for insects on the ground outside
my window. The local field guide said it was Swainson's Thrush. Seemed unique, so I used it.
