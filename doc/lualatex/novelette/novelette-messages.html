<h2>Messages</h2>
<p class="noindent">Warnings, Errors, Alerts, Info, and other messages
may come from several places. The most baffling are from the essential
compiler program and its core support. Fortunately, you will only see them
if you make a syntax error in your document (command name wrong,
used a number where you should have used a length, and so forth).</p>
<p>Somewhat more intelligble messages come from packages used by Novelette.
For example, headers and footers are handled by the <i>fancyhdr</i> package.
If you get an error or warning from <i>fancyhdr</i>, it means that you
attempted to write a header/footer that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Novelette provides its own messages. When it issues a Warning or Error,
it will specifically tell you how to fix it. Requesting more help is
ineffective, since all the help you need is already there.</p>
<p>In a few cases, good code may not be what you intended. Novelette cannot
read your mind, so it is unsure whether what you wrote is what you meant.
Then, it will write an Alert message to the log file. If you write command
<code>\warnalert{on}</code> in Preamble, then a Warning will be issued if one
or more Alerts are present. GUI programs cannot detect the Alerts, but they
can detect a Warning. When you are satisfied that the Alerts are not
problems, remove <code>\warnalert{on}</code>.</p>
<p>Near the end of the log file, Novelette writes a Summary for your document.
It shows the various settings, as they were actually used. It also shows
the default values calculated within Novelette. And, it suggests suitable
sizes for images, if you use them.</p>
