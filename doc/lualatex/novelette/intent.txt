INTENT

This determines PDF/X-1a:2001 conformance (or not).
In Preamble:
	\intent{choice}
where the choice is one of: SWOP FOGRA JC none. Case-sensitive. Default SWOP.

Explanation:

PDF/X, particularly PDF/X-1a:2001, is a PDF format intended for the most
reliable exchange to a printing machine. The format requires that certain
things be in the PDF, and that other things must not be in the PDF.

Your home or office printer does not need PDF/X, because its technology will
understand almost anything you provide, and can guess the rest.
All you really need is font embedding.
Some commercial print-on-demand services do the same thing.

But other commercial print services require more than font embedding.
Their printers will not attempt to understand anything vague in the PDF.
They will not attempt to guess what you mean. This ensures that PDF files
can be rapidly and accutately exchanged between the producer and the printer,
with the least delay. PDF/X format is intended for this purpose.

There are several varieties of PDF/X. The lowest common denominator, with the
strictest requirements, is PDF/X-1a:2001. It is all you need for printed
book interiors. If your print service requires PDF/X-1a:2001, Novelette
has the built-in capability.

All PDF/X formats require an "output intent" declaration, which states
the kind of printer expected by the PDF producer. It does not force that
printer. The output intent is important for accurate color rendition.
But your book interior will not use color, so the output intent will be
ignored. Nevertheless, an output intent must be declared, simply because
it is part of the PDF/X specification.

Here are your choices:
	\intent{none}     -> PDF will not be PDF/X.
	\intent{SWOP}     -> Default PDF/X with "US Web Coated SWOP" output intent.
	\intent{FOGRA}    -> PDF/X with FOGRA39 output intent (Europe).
    \intent{JC200103} -> PDF/X with JC200103 output intent (Japan). 
No *.icc color profile will be attached.

IMPORTANT:
	If there was an error (and some warnings) during compile, the resulting
PDF will automatically have \intent{none}, regardless of your setting.
