Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress, as of late February 2023. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change. Thus, no documentation yet.
Power users can get a glimpse of what Novelette will do, by looking into
the code.

Expected release late March 2023.

UPDATE, March 30, 2023: Doing tweaks. Code works, needs finishing touches.
Still waiting for my system to install TeXlive 2023.

UPDATE, March 23, 2023: Novelette works in its most essential features.
The frills also work, but are likely to be revised. Since TeXlive 2023
will soon be available, I will delay Novelette until my own system has
both 2022 and 2023 running.

Development continues. Documentation is very preliminary (what you see
inside doc directory is really just some basic info). Currently, I am tweaking
some of the alignment settings. The included Swainson fonts are not yet
ready for building to *.otf.

The novelette-example.pdf file is s short example, at the current development.
