LANGUAGE

After much thought, Novelette has been limited to the English language. (NOTE)
In Preamble, write one of these:
	\setlang{american}
	\setlang{british}
	\setlang{english}
The only difference involves adjustments to hyphenation patterns, due to
slight spelling differences in American and British English.

Note that the language only selects hypenation patterns. It is not a spelling
or grammar check. It does not automatically formate dates and times, or
anything else.

If you do not set either "american" or "british", then generic "english"
will be used. It is better to specifically request american or british.
Note that these are all lowercase,

Why not more languages? To keep it as simple as possible, Novelette does not
include the code needed for internationalization. The problem is that TeX
likes to use some keyboard characters in a manner that has differenct meanings
in different languages. 

Your writing may include words or short phrases in another language. They will
be treated as if they were (mis-spelled) English words.


NOTE: Maybe not limited. I will think about it some more. Definitely limited to
Western European languages, for technical reasons.
