Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change.

Update: April 27, 2023: The essential code works, as far as I can tell.
Testing welcome. The HTML documentation will have a mjaor revision, so that
it is more readable by new TeX users. Over the next few week, I intend to
add "docmute" capability (if it works the way I hope it will), but that
would not affect the essential code. Still tweaking.
