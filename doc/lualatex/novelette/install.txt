HOW TO INSTALL NOVELETTE

Your TeX installation must have lualatex.

Beyond the base LaTeX files that everyone should have, Novelette requires
these additional packages:
iftex luatex85 pdftexcmds infwarerr ltxcmds xparse expl3 xpatch
letltxmacro etoolbox xifthen ifmtarg xstring fontspec microtype
luahyphenrules fp silence atbegshi changepage noindentafter

Install the Libertinus Serif fonts. This is TeX package `libertinus-serif'.
You may use them for your document, if you wish. But even if you prefer
different fonts, Libertinus Serif can be used as "Plan B" for placing
characters that are not in your preferred fonts. 

Perhaps someday Novelette will be package `novelette' in CTAN. Then you will
be able to install it like any other package. Until then:

Place Novelette files in your `texmf-local' or user-specific TEXMFHOME
directory. Use the same directory structure that you see in the Novelette
project page at https://github.com/rallg/novelette. Only place the `doc'
and `tex' directories and their contents.

Then update the TeX file system (command-line mktexlsr).
