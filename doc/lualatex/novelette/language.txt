LANGUAGE

Novelette is intended for popular fiction, often print-on-demand, in
American and possibly British markets. For this reason, the choice of
language is very limited. Others may be added in the future (no promises).

Command \setlang allows you to choose at most one of:
	american british spanish
If you ask for english, you will get american. Sorry, lads.

If you do not use \setlang, default is american.

The language does not load babel or polyglossia. All it does is load
hyphenation patterns (if installed) for the requested language.

No matter what language you set, you may write in any language. Novelette
will not complain. The language setting does not check spelling or syntax.
It does not change punctuation. All it does is select a hyphenation pattern.

You cannot load the `lipsum' package. If you need some nonsense text for
testing layout, the built-in \darkandstormy command may be used in the
document body.
