Swainson Fonts README

Currently, this directory contains plain text files, in the FontForge *.sfd format, but with extension re-named as *txt.

The developer is still working on these. Not even close to finished.

The files are provided for backup purposes. When the fonts are finished,
these files will be replaced by their *otf fonts.
