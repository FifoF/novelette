<h2>Novelette - Documentation</h2>

<h2>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h2>


<p>Document class <i>novelette</i> is unlike any other LaTeX document class:
(a) It requires LuaLaTeX; (b) It does not honor widely-used LaTeX commands;
(c) It has its own methods for setting layout and other properties,
specifically written for those who have very little knowledge of LaTeX;
(d) The resulting PDF is created for printed (to paper) popular fiction,
such as detective novels, printed in black ink only; (e) There is no capability
for Ebooks or any kind of academic works.</p> 

<p>QUICK START: Here is a model document template. Each of its commands is a

<a id="lualatex"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". Some GUI programs (TeXworks, TeXstudio, etc.)
can read this line. It tells them to use <i>lualatex</i> compiler, regardless
of what the program uses for its standard compiler.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, be sure to use </i>lualatex</i>.
Anything else will be rejected.</p>
</div>

<a id="utf-8"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". It tells some GUI programs that the characters
have utf-8 encoding. You must type your document using utf-8, without its
"byte order mark" (BOM). This is essential. It is the default encoding for
Linux and Mac. On Windows, be sure to configure your text editor for
utf-8 without BOM.</p>
</div>

<a id="documentclass"></a>
<div>
<h3>\documentclass{novelette}</h3>
<p>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette has no class options.
Anything you need is set by one of the other commands in Preamble,
or is automatically calculated from other settings.</p>
<p>The \documentclass begins the Preamble, where you place settings.</p>
</div>

<a id="mode"></a>
<div>
<h3>\mode{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>Novelette has four modes: draft, shade, align, final. If you do not set
the mode, its default is draft.</p>
<p><b>draft</b> disables PDF/X conformance (see <a href="#intent">intent</a>).
It places DRAFT at the top left of each page. The PDF title is changed,
to include the word DRAFT. Otherwise, the layout, line breaks, and page breaks
are the same as they will be, when you graduate to final mode.</p>
<p><b>shade</b> is draft mode, with margins tinted gray.</p>
<p><b>align</b> is shade/draft mode, with text baselines marked.</p>
<p><b>final</b> should only be used when you are ready. In final mode,
Novelette performs some checks that it would otherwise omit (to save time).
If your document fails one of the checks, you will be warned. Then itt will
automatically revert to draft mode, so that the PDF cannot be confused with
the final file.</p>
</div>

<a id="intent"></a>
<div>
<h3>\intent{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>There are four intents: none, SWOP, FOGRA39, JC200103. Default is none.</p>
<p>No matter which intent you choose, fonts are subset embedded. That is enough
for some print services. But many print services require PDF/X conformance,
especially <span style="white-space:nowrap">PDF/X-1a:2001.</span></p>
<p>When a file conforms to PDF/X, it must have a certain internal structure.
Among the requirements is an "output intent", which states that the PDF was
prepared according to the requirements of a particular print technology.
It does not force the printer to use that technology.</p>
<p>Your file will be printed by an industrial-strength photocopier or inkjet,
rather than the offset presses declared by intent. In any case, the intent is
irrelevant for books using only black ink. Nevertheless, an intent must be
declared, even though it is useless; it is part of the PDF/X standards.</p>
<p>You are urged to use an intent, other than <i>none</i>, for the final PDF.
This enables additional checks, hopefully reducing the possibility that your
file will be rejected by the print service.</p>
<p><b>none</b> does not produce PDF/X. No matter how you set intent, it will
automatically be changed to <i>none</i> unless you are in final mode.</p>
<p><b>SWOP</b> means "US Web Coated SWOP". This is most frequently used in
the United States.</p>
<p><b>FOGRA39</b> (actually FOGRA39L) is frequently used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>JC200103</b> is frequently used in Japan.</p>
</div>

<a id="setlang"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setlang{<i>code</i>}</h3>
<p>This command sets the language hyphenation pattern. Only one language
may be chosen, from a <a href="#langlist">list</a>. It does not set anything
other than hyphenation.</p>
<p>You may write some text in another language; but if you do, it will be
hyphenated according to the rules chosen by <i>\setlang</i>.</p>
<p>The available languages all use Latin-based characters. This includes all
well-known Western European languages, and some from Eastern Europe.
Any language with non-Latin characters (Greek, Cyrillic), or stacked
diacritical marks (Vietnamese), or right-to-left text, is not supported.</p>
</div>

<a id="title"></a>
<div>
<h3>\title{<i>Title of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>When you use a print-on-demand service, you will provide the book title.
This </i>\title</i> must be exactly the same. Also, it must be the same
on the printed title page, on the copyright page, in page headers (if you use
them), and generally anywhere the title is expected. Novelette does not do
cover artwork, but the cover must have exactly the same title.</p>
<p>The title must use the Latin character sets. Some print services limit
to Latin-1; others allow more extended Latin characters. Curly apostrophe
and curly quotes are not Latin characters, but Novelette will convert them
to the acceptable straight variety.</p>
<p>You may not use TeX code, such as requesting Italics. You may not use code
such as \`A for Agrave, but you may directly place Ã€ from a Unicode character
map.</p>
<p>Exception: If any of characters @ # $ % & { } appear in the title, they must
be preceded by a backslash, as in \title{The \$20 Balloon}.</p>
</div>

<a id="author"></a>
<div>
<h3>\author{<i>Author of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>The considerations for <i>\title</i> apply, with these additional:</p>
<p>Novelette is not intended for academic works. There should be a single
author (in some cases, two equal authors, using a single <i>\author</i>).</p>
<p>Whether the author is your real name, or a pseudonym, is up to you.
If in doubt, ask the print service.</p>
<p>If you use a pseudonym, then you should probably use your real name as
copyright holder, on the copyright page. Then, if someone unlawfully copies
your book, it will be easier to enforce the copyright. Otherwise, you will
have to prove that "Fakename Author" is actually "Realname You" before
distributors will honor your requests.</p>
<p>And, if you do use a pseudonym, request that distributors (and libraries)
have it indexed under the desired name (pseudonym or real name).</p>
</div>

<a id="trimsize"></a>
<div>
<h3>\trimsize{width=<i>size</i>,height=<i>size</i>}</h3>
<p>Trim Size is the size of your book pages. Be sure to choose cream paper
(creme, off-white), not white paper. The print service will offer a choice
of several standard sizes.</p>
<p>Dimensions are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm).
Examples:<p>
<p>\trimsize{width=5.5in,height=8.5in} % American Digest.</p>
<p>\trimsize{width=129mm,height=198mm} % British B-Format.</p>
<p>The name "trim size" comes from the manufacturing process. The pages are
printed on larger paper, then roughly cut and assembled with glue.
The cover is attached with glue, then the entire book is "trimmed" with
a cutting device. This is why such books have all page edges aligned.</p>
<p>In the case of library hardcover books, trim size refers to the interior
pages. The cover size is slightly larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="sheetfeed"></a>
<div>
<h3>\sheetfeed{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>Do not use the \sheetfeed setting, unless you are certain that you need it.
If you use this setting incorrectly, big problems will result. Do not guess.
Available choices are <i>letter</i> and <i>A4</i>.</p>
<p>If you do not use \sheetfeed, the PDF page size will be the same as the
book trim size. This is how nearly all print-on-demand services want it.</p>
<p><b>letter</b> centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally, in the
larger USletter size (8.5in width, 11in height),</p>
<p><b>A4</b> (or a4) centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally,
in the larger European A4 size (210mm width, 297mm height).</p>
<p>If you are printing pages at home, for manual editing, then you might
use letter or A4, to produce consistent results from your home printer.
That might also be the case, if your book will be reviewed by an editor.</p>
<p>Novelette does not produce crop marks or trim marks. It does write the
internal "TrimBox" metadata to the PDF.</p>
</div>

<a id="margins"></a>
<div>
<h3>\margins{top=<i>size</i>,outside=<i>size</i>,bottom=<i>size</i>,inside=<i>size</i>}</h3>
<p>In Novelette, margins surround the printable area. Nothing may be printed
within the margins. The header, main text, and footer all must fit within the
rectangle surrounded by the margins. This is how the term "margins" is used
by most print services.</p>
<p>Word processors usually place header within the top margin, and footer
within the bottom margin.</p>
<p>Margins are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm). It is best
to use the same units for margins, as you use for trim size.</p>
<p><b>top</b> margin is the area above the topmost printable item, which
is the header (if your page style uses header), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>outside</b> margin is the area at the outer page edge, being the left
side of even-numbered (verso) pages, or the right side of odd-numbered (recto)
pages.</p>
<p><b>bottom</b> margin is the area below the lowest printable item, which
is the footer (if your page layout uses footer), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>inside</b> margin as at the spine (binding). In general, this margin
should be set 0.125in (or 3mm) wider than the ouside margin. The extra width
allows for binding glue.</p>
<p>You may abbreviate the margins setting, with a single value:<br>
\margins{<i>size</i>} sets top, ouside, and bottom margins to that size.
Inside margin is set 0.125in (or 3mm) larger.</p>
<p>If you do not set margins, Novelette will set them for you. At smaller
trim sizes, the margins will be at the minimum required by print services.
At larger trim size, the margins will be larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="layout"></a>
<div>
<h3>\layout{<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>,<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>}</h3>
<p>The \layout command accepts one or more comma-separated key=value pairs.</p>
<p><b>style=<i>integer</i></b><br>Integer from 1 to 7 selects page style,
(header and/or footer) from a menu of available styles. The default style
depends on other page design settings.</p>
<p><b>headgap=<i>number</i></b><br>Number is integer|decimal from 0 to 1.
Value 0 (rarely used) places header at the line immediately above main text.
Value 1 skips a whole line between header and main text, and is best for
large books. Value 0.5 is a nice compromise for smaller books.
The headgap is ignored if style has no header.</p>
<p><b>footgap=<i>number</i></b><br>As with headgap, but pertains to gap
between main text and footer. Ignored if style has no footer.</p>
<p><b>scale=<i>number</i></b><br>
Sets the scale of header/footer text, relative to size of main font.
Acceptable range is 0.75 to 1, but must evaluate to at least 8.03pt.</p>
</div>

<a id="text"></a>
<div>
<h3>\text{<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>,<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>}</h3>
<p>The \text command accepts one or more comma-separated key=value pairs.</p>
<p><b>fontsize=<i>size</i></b><br>Sets the size of main text font. Integer
or decimal. Typical value near 11.5pt. Must have units pt (TeX points) or
bp (PostScript points). Instead of fontsize, you may set emperline.</p>
<p><b>emperline=<i>number</i></b><br>Number of font em per line of main text.
Alternative to fontsize. Typical value near 28.</p>
<p><b>lines=<i>integer</i></b><br>Number of lines in main text block, not
counting header or footer. The default number depends on page sizes.</p>
<p><b>openings=<i>code</i></b><br>Sets the style of "opening" environments,
which are used at places such as the start of chapters. The code may be
one of l c r o i for left, center, right, outside, inside alignment of items
in the opening.</p>
<p><b>footnotes=<i>code</i></b><br>Sets the style of footnotes. Default style
uses literary markers (asterisk, dagger, etc.), first line of each footnote
is not indented, line separating footnotes from main text is centered.
Code n sets markers to numerals. Code i indents first line of each footnote.
Code l aligns the separator to left. Total code 1-3 letters.</p>
</div>


<a id="setfont"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setfont{<i>role</i>}{<i>Font Name</i>}[<i>features</i>]</h3>
<p>Novelette uses <i>fontspec</i> technology for Open Type fonts. If you are
a knowledgeable LaTeX user, you may use some aspects of <i>fontspec</i>
directly, but that is strongly discouraged, due to potential layout conflict.
Do not use <i>\setmainfont</i>.</p>
<p><i>\setfont</i> has two mandatory arguments, and an optional argument.</p>
<p><b>role</b> is a keyword, one of: <i>main deco</i>.
It assigns the font to its proper place and purpose.</p>
<p><b>Font Name</b> is the Open Type font family name. Examples are Swainson,
EB Garamond, Libertinus Serif. No TeX fonts with three-letter codes.</p>
<p><b>features</b> is an optional, comma-separated list of Open Type features,
using <i>fontspec</i> syntax.</p>
</div>

<a id="guides"></a>
<div>
<h3>\guides{integer,integer,integer,integer}</h3>
<p>You may create four or fewer pairs of guides. These are marks in the
side margins, when in shade or align mode. The guides align with main text
baseline and descender, at the integer line number from top of main text.</p>
<p>Guides are not enforced. They are merely for your own use. Typically,
a guide is placed where you wish the topmost item in openings to sit, and
another guide is placed at the first line of main text under the opening.</p>
<p>If you use guides, they will be the same on every page.</p>
</div>

<a id="begindoc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{document}</h3>
<p>This command is the boundary between the Preamble above it, and the
printable book below it.</p>
<p>If you ever get an error message "Missing \begin{document}" and wonder why,
it means that you made a syntax error somewhere in the Preamble.</p>
</div>


<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->

<a id="frontmatter"></a>
<div>
<h3>\frontmatter</h3>
<p>This command tells the processor to begin page numbering with lowercase
roman numeral i, and continue as ii, iii, iv, v, ... until the \mainmatter
command is reached.</p>
<p>The absolute minimum frontmatter contains the title page and copyright page.
In practice, minimum frontmatter contains six pages: half-title page,
blank page, title page, copyright page, visual break page, blank page.</p>
<p>Even if the style calls for header and/or footer, it is generally the
case that frontmatter pages do not display either header or footer. The
exception is when something in frontmatter is extended, such as a multi-page
Introduction.</p>
</div>

<a id="mainmatter"></a>
<div>
<h3>\mainmatter</h3>
<p>The \mainmatter command tells the processor to change page numbering to
Arabic numerals, starting with 1, and continue as 2, 3, 4, ... until the
end of the book. There is no command to change to a different style or count
at any later place in the book.</p>
<p>There is a difference between "PDF page number" and "printed page number".
The PDF page number uses only Arabic numerals, beginning at 1, and continuing
without reset. The printed page number changes style and resets.</p>
<p>Nearly all pages in mainmatter display their page numbers. The exceptions
are chapter openings (and similar pages) that omit headers; if page numbers
would be in the omitted headers, they are not shown there. Novelette does not
provide for the "drop folio" method used by some academic works.</p>




<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h3>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and can also be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">\desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>The <a href="#openings">\text{openings=<i>code</i>}</a> command
determines the default alignment of items within an opening. To vertically
position items, use the <i>\null</i> command, as often as necessary,
to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>

<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h3>
<p>The \name command  may only be used
within the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number. This is not intended for more than
one line of text.</p>
</div>

<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\desc{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h3>
<p>The \desc command may only be used in an <a href="#opening">opening</a>
environment. If used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text. If necessary, you may use
\desc more than once, for multiple lines. However, multiple lines would
probably look better in ordinary main text.</p>
</div>


<a id="cleartoend"></a>
<div>
<h3>\cleartoend</h3>
<p>The final page of your book must be a blank verso. The \cleartoend command
tells the processor to add one or two blank pages, as necessary.</p>
</div>

<a id="enddoc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\end{document}</h3>
<p>This command ends your book. If you write anything underneath it, such as
a note to yourself, it will be ignored.</p>
</div>

<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->

<a id="whichfonts"></a>
<div>
<h3>Which Fonts to Use?</h3>
<P>You may use any free, shareware, or commercial OpenType font. There is
no need to limit yourself to fonts from the LaTeX font catalog. In fact,
many LaTeX fonts are not available as OpenType.</p>
<p>Many, but not all, TrueType fonts are also OpenType, in this context.
However, Novelette cannot handle TrueType "collections" bound into a single
file.</p>
<p>Desirable fonts for fiction will often say that they are similar to
Garamond, Caslon, or Bembo. Some are more similar than others, but that
is not relevant. Such fonts are designed for casual reading, where the eye
will not dwell on a particular item of interest. The Swainson font,
included with Novelette, is in this category; but it has a limited character
set, and you are not required to use it.</p>
<p>Fonts such as Times (New) Roman, and the TeX Latin Modern Roman,
do not perform as well in fiction. Times was designed for relatively crowded
newsprint. LMR was designed for academic papers.</p>
<p>Print-on-demand technology uses high-speed photocopy or inkjet machines.
The text will not be as dark as traditional offset presses (although at
least one service offers "premium black ink", whatever that is). So, be sure
that you are not using overly slender fonts. If your pages do not look
good when you print the PDF in a photocopier, then they probably will not
look better when bound into a book.</p>
<p>Be sure that your fonts are properly licensed for commercial use, and be
sure that use of the fonts does not obligate you to give away the source
code or finished PDF, or the printed book. Fonts with the "GPL" (GNU Public
License) cannot be used, unless they also bear a "font exception" releasing
you from some of the GPL terms. Beware of free fonts that do not have
enough information (such as Copyright) to ascertain the creator. Copyright
is good, as long as you have the license you need. One well-known free
license is the "SIL Open Font License" (OFL). There are others. Or, pay
for the license of commercial or shareware fonts.</p>
<p>Among LaTeX OpenType fonts, EB Garamond and Libertinus Serif are probably
good enough. There are others. EBG is slightly light, and LS is slightly
upright. Do have a look at Swainson.</p>
</div>


<a id="aboutcopyright"></a>
<div>
<p>The Copyright page is very important. It will be carefully examined by
robots and humans.</p>
<p>The page must contain: The book title; the book author (possibly pseudonym),
the book copyright year (with true Copyright symbol Â©) and name of copyright
holder (your real name). Some books continue with an elaborate prohibition
against this-and-that, but perhaps "All Rights Reserved: is sufficient;
that is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<p>Under no conditions use "copyleft" or anything implying that you are
being charitable.<p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to provide further information regarding the
use of copyrighted material, public domain material, or trademarks. That is
beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<p>If your book has a library catalog (call) number, put it on the copyright
page. Nowadays, works of popular fiction (especially print-on-demand) do not
need this. If a library wants your book, it will be filed by author surname
in a section with similar books (such as Murder Mysteries) rather than by
call number. If your book becomes a work for the ages, a call number can
be added later.</p>
<p>Provide sufficient information so that the publisher (you) can be
identified and contacted. What you need to provide may vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. It may be as simple as your name, city, nation. The print
service may encourage or discourage providing the URL of your web site.</p>
<p>You cannot imply that the print and distribution service is the publisher,
because it is not.</p>
<p>You cannot be sure that copies of your book will be printed in any
specific location, or using any specific paper or technology, or according
to any particular environmental standard.</p>
<p>Most nations require an "Impressum" or similar declaration that identifies
the actual printer, and place where printed. This may vary from copy to copy.
In books I have sent through print-on-demand in the USA, this information is
printed on the final verso page, added by the machine at time of printing
(which is why the final verso page must be submitted as blank).</p> 
<p>The Copyright page must also show its ISBN (number, not bar code). The only
exception are books that have a small number of private copies, not available
for purchase by others, and not listed in the distribution system.</p>
</div>


<a id="visualbarrier"></a>
<div>
<p>Unless your book has very few pages (glorified pamphlet), something must
come between the Copyright page and the first page of the story. It is
visually distracting to have copyright legalese visible at left, when you
are trying to start a romance or fantasy setting at right.</p>
<p>To create a visual barrier, the simplest practice is to put something
on the recto page facing copyright, with its verso blank. The qiestion is,
what to put on that recto page?</p>
<p>One possibility is a Dedication. Over-used, in my opinion. That's what
web sites are for. If you dedicate the book to Suzy, who subsequently dumps
you, then years later you marry Anna, you don't want Anna nagging you
about Suzy. Thank Suzy on a web page, then when she dumps you, delete it.</p>
<p>Another possibility, under-used but very effective, is an Epigraph.
This is a short item of prose or poetry, intended to set the tone. It could
be pretentious (quoting Shakespeare) or not. Major commercial authors will
sometimes quote each other, because their common publisher fixes it.
Bu don't you do that. Even if your quote the Bible, be sure that the
translation is in the Public Domain (this is why KJV is widely used).</p>
<p>You can quote imaginary works, or your own book. Perhaps the most famous
Epigraph in modern fiction is the One Ring inscription (Lord of the Rings).</p>
<p>You can use a Table of Contents, if it is short. This is unusual, unless
the book is a collection of short stories.</p>
<p>You can simply repeat the half-title. Even major publishers sometimes
do this.</p>
