<h2>Setup</h2>


<a id="basics"></id>
<div>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Novelette requires a working TeX installation, with Luatex support.
To ensure that you have it, copy this code to file <code>test.tex</code>
in your home directory. Use a plain text editor with utf-8 encoding,
without BOM (byte order mark). That is standard for Linux and Mac, but if
you are on Windows, use a program such as <i>Notepad++</i>, NOT Windows
Notepad. Code:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\documentclass{article}<br>
\usepackage{fontspec}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
Hello World<br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>Then try to build it to PDF. If you are using a GUI program
(TeXworks, etc.) be sure that you specify <i>lualatex</i> as the engine.
If you are using command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>lualatex test</code></p>
<p>If that fails:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the system cannot find a program named <i>lualatex</i>, try to build
with this instead:<br>
<code>luahbtex --fmt=latex test</code><br>
If that works, it means your system (probably a Linux variant) needs a tweak:
As root user, navigate to the directory where TeX keeps its binaries. That can
be discovered via <code>which luahbtex</code>. In that directory, create a symlink:<br>
<code>ln -s luahbtex lualatex</code><br>
Then try to build with <i>lualatex</i>. This time, it should work.</li>
<li>If you get this error: "LuaTeX is required to compile this document. Sorry."
It means that you did not compile with <i>lualatex</i>. Be sure to do that,
and try again.</i>
<li>If you get an error saying that <i>fontspec</i> is not installed, or that
<i>fontspec.sty</i> was not found, then use your TeX package installer, and
get <i>fontspec</i> plus its dependent packages. If using command line:<br>
<code>tlmgr install --reinstall l3kernel xparse<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc fontspec</code></li>
</ul>
</div>


<a id="packages"></a>
<div>
<h3>Supporting Packages</h3>
<p>After the test document builds successfully, install the other packages
required by Novelette. Some or all of them may already be installed.</p>
<p>If you are using MiKTeX, and have it set to automatically install missing
packages on-the-fly, do this: Edit the above <i>test.tex</i> file.
Change the document class to <code>novelette</code> and build it with
<i>lualatex</i>. MiKTeX will obtain the packages you need.</p>
<p>If you are using command line instead, use the TeX package installer:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
tlmgr install --reinstall iftex luatex85 pdftexcmds infwarerr<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall ltxcmds xparse expl3 xpatch xifthen<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall letltxmacro etoolbox noindentafter<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall ifmtarg xstring luahyphenrules<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall fp silence atbegshi changepage<br>
tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc fontspec microtype
</code></p>
<p>Then, try a new test document:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
Welcome to Novelette.<br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
</div>


<a id="reqfont"></a>
<div><h3>Required Font</h3>
<p>Although TeX uses <i>Latin Modern Roman</i> as default font, it is utterly
unsuitable for popular fiction, particularly when using print-on-demand.
You will need to use a different font.</p>
<p>Novelette expects that you have <i>Libertinus Serif</i> installed where TeX
can find it. In MiKTeX, install <code>libertinus-fonts</code>.
In TeXlive command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>tlmgr install libertinus-fonts</code></p>
<p>Note that other packages with <i>libertinus</i> in the name, are something
else. You want <i>libertinus-fonts</i>.</p>
<p>If you do not use
<a href="novelette-preamble.html#setfont"><code>\setfont</code></a>
to choose something else, Novelette will use <i>Libertinus Serif</i> as
main font. It is suited to popular fiction, although there are other fonts
that look as good (or better) for this purpose.</p>
<p>Since <i>Libertinus Serif</i> has a reasonably large character set,
Novelette uses it as "Plan B" when your chosen main font does not have a
practicular character. For example, if your chosen main font does not have
the Greek lowercase letter "pi", you can get it this way:</p>
<p class="code"><code>Pecan \altfont{\uni{03C0}} with ice cream.</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>\uni{03C0}</code> requests Unicode 03C0, which is pi.</p>
<p>If you do not choose your own main font, and do not have
<i>Libertinus Serif</i> as default, then Novelette will use <i>Latin Modern
Roman</i>. but it will issue a warning, and prevent using final mode.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Your Font</h3>
<p>Novelette can use any OpenType font (extension <code>otf</code>)
and some TrueType fonts (extension <code>ttf</code>). It cannot use Type 1
fonts (extension <code>pfb, afm, pfm, vf</code>).</p>
<p>The TeX Font Catalog (online web page) shows samples of all fonts that
can be installed within TeX. However, you are not limited to those fonts.
On most platforms, Novelette can find fonts installed in the operating system,
not just the ones installed within TeX. But be sure that the fonts are
licensed for your purpose.</p>
<p>Each font must have a license that permits embedding, for printed
books, for profit. Many "free" or system fonts do not have a suitable license.
In particular, DO NOT use any font that comes with the "GNU Public License"
(GPL) unless it also has a "font exception" clause that allows embedding
for any purpose.</p>
<p>Some fonts have a free version, and a paid version. You might need the
paid version. Some fonts come with a program, and can only be used for
files created by that program. Novelette cannot verify the license; this is
your responsibilty.</p>
<p>Your print-on-demand book will be printed using a high-speed photocopier,
not offset press (unless you strike it rich). Before committing to a font,
create test files, for each <i>Font Name</i>. Select either <i>letter</i>
or <i>A4</i> depending on what size paper is used. Note that this is not
the same as your book page size:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\setfont{main}{<i>Font Name</i>}<br>
\sheetfeed{<i>letter or A4</i>}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
\fillertext<br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>Print the PDF on a photocopier that can print directly from digital files.
Where I live, this kind of machine is often at print/ship services. Be sure
to specify non-color print.</p>
<p>The name of the main font will be printed above the filler text. That way,
you can print several test files, and know which font is which.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to how dark the characters print. Fonts intended
for offset presses may print too light. Pay attention to the reading
experience: Does the text flow the way you expect in fiction, or does it look
more like a textbook?</p>
<p>Only <i>you</i> can decide.</p>
