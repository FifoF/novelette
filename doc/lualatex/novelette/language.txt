LANGUAGE

Novelette uses its own method for setting language and options:
	\setlang{code}[option] -OR- \setlang*{code}[option]
Notice that the command is NOT \setlanguage or \language or anything else.

The language code must be selected from a limited number of choices:
	da -> Danish.
	is -> Icelandic.
	nl -> Dutch.
	es -> Spanish.
	pt -> Portuguese.
	it -> Italian.
	ca -> Catalan.
	oc -> Occitan.
	fi -> Finnish.
	sv -> Swedish.
	ga -> Gaelic (Irish).
	cy -> Welsh.
	eu -> Basque.
	fr (or) fr-FR -> French, except Swiss.
	fr-CH -> Swiss French.
	de (or) de-DE -> German, except Swiss.
	de-CH -> Swiss German.
	en (or) en-GB -> British English.
	en-US -> American English
	no (or) nb -> Norwegian Bokmal.
    nn -> Norwegian Nynorsk.
	xx -> No hyphenation.

If \setlang is not specified, the default is an old version of English.
There will be a warning message. If you actually intend to use English, then
be sure to request either en-GB or en-US. 

The language selection does NOT perform spelling or grammar check. It does NOT
transform words, dates, times, or currency. All it does is apply hyphenation
rules, and (fr and fr-CH) some spacing.

Since hyphenation for Canadian French is the same as for France, there is
no separate setting for Canadian. Similarly for Mexico vs. Spain, and most
oher languages.

The command may be written with or without an asterisk (star). For most
languages, there is no difference between \setlang and \setlang*.

In the case of German, \setlang applies post-1996 hyphenation.
\setlang* uses the older (1901) rules.

In the case of French (fr), \setlang adds space before : ; ! ? punctuation.
It also adds space after opening guillemet, and before closing guillemet.
\setlang* does not add spaces. It might be useful if you already
typed the spaces.

Swiss French (fr-CH) is like French (fr), except that space is not added
before the : colon character.

The optional argument is only used for French and Swiss French.
If [-g] is provided as option, then no space is added before or after
guillemets.

If you wish to change the style of footnotes, see the \text command.
