<h3>Front Matter</h3>

<p>Front Matter, or <i>frontmatter</i>, contains information "about the book"
rather than "the story itself". The absolute minimum is a Title Page and
Copyright Page. The practical minimum is six pages. It is rare for an
original work of popular fiction to have more than six pages of frontmatter.
Books with longer frontmatter are either non-fiction, or reprints of older
works in critical editions.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Here is a model for six pages of frontmatter. Each of its commands is a
hyperlink within this documentation. Click to learn what the commands do,
and how to choose their values.</p>
<p>The <code>\null</code> command inserts a blank line. May be repeated.
Actual frontmatter pages will often have many <code>\null</code> to provide
space at the top of the page, or between items on the page.</p>

</div>


<a id="frontmatter"></a>
<div>
<h4><code>\frontmatter</code></h4>
<p>This command immediately follows <code>\begin{document}</code>. It tells
TeX to use lowercase roman page numbers (i, ii, ...) and to omit the header
and footer. Thus, no page numbers are printed. Although there is no visible
header or footer, they still occupy space.</p>
</div>


<a id="memo"></a>
<div>
<h4><code>\memo{<i>Non-printing text.</i>}</code></h4>
<p>Novelette strongly discourages the use of percent <code>%</code> for comments.
This is because % is a useful text character. If you forget to write
<code>\%</code> with the backslash, then the remainder of the text line does
not print. That may not be what you intended to do.</p>
<p>Instead, use the <code>\memo{}</code> command. Its content does not print.
The content may be multi-line. It may be quite lengthy.</p>
<p>The memo may not be in the middle of a paragraph. It must stand by itself.</p>
</div>


<a id="display"></a>
<div>
<h4><code>\begin{display} ... \end{display}</code></h4>
<p>A <i>display page</i> stands by itself. Its appearance, and alignment of
content, is unrelated to ordinary text pages.</p>
<p>No matter how much or how little content, <code>\begin{display}</code>
ensures that it starts on its own page, and <code>\end{display}</code>
finishes that page, so that following material will be on a new page.</p>
<p>Do not put so much content that the display flows to a second page.
If necessary, use two display pages.</p>
</div>


<a id="style"></a>
<div>
<h4><code>\style[<i>options</i>]{<i>Styled Text</i>}</code></h4>
<p>The <code>\style</code> command may only be used on a display page.
This command allows you to place text that otherwise would not obey the
main alignment rules. It has several comma-separated options:</p>
<ul>
<li>font=<i>choice</i> (choose <i>main</i> or <i>deco</i>) Default main.</li>
<li>bold=<i>choice</i> (choose <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>) Default false.</li>
<li>scale=<i>number</i> (integer or decimal, relative to main text) Default 1.</li>
<li>align=<i>choice</i> (choose l c r o i) Default c.<br>
l=left, c=center, r=right. o=outside, i=inside.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Example usage:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\style[scale=2.5,font=deco]{Hello World}</code><br>
Hello World is printed with the deco font, at 2.5x scale, aligned center, not bold.</p>
<p>If you wish to use Italics, small caps, or other text features, put those
commands within the styled text.</p>
<p>Note that Novelette does not honor the standard TeX commands for bold text.
Only the <code>\style</code> command may request bold.</p>
</div>


<a id="blankpage"></a>
<div>
<h4><code>\blankpage</code></h4>
<p>This command closes the preceding page, inserts a blank page, and ensures
that following material begins on a new page.</p>
<p>Do not write consecutive blank pages. They may automatically appear at
the very end of your book.</p>
</div>


<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->


<a id="halftitle"></a>
<div>
<h3>Half-Title</h3>
<p>The Half-Title, or <i>halftitle</i>, is a page containing only the title
of your book. No subtitle, no author, nothing else. The title may be styled,
but it should not be as prominent (that is, smaller scale) as it will appear
on the Title Page.</p>
<p>The halftitle is a custom dating back to the era when the printed pages
were not immediately bound, but were stored for later binding (if ever).
The halftitle was essentially a dust cover for the real Title Page.
This custom has endured. Nowadays, it provides you with a place to write
something, without marking the Title Page.</p>
<p>The halftitle page is simple:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\begin{display}<br>
\null\null\null\null<br>
\style[options]{Title of Your Book}<br>
\end{display}
</code></p>
<p>The four <code>\null</code> commands insert four lines, before the
printed halftitle. Use as many or as few as you wish.</p>
</div>


<a id="titlepage"></a>
<div>
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>The title page must contain the title, subtitle (if any), and author name.
Professional publishers identify themselves at the base of this page.</p>
<p>Although the title page will use <code>\null</code> commands for vertical
spacing, they are omitted here. Example title page:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\begin{display}<br>
\style[options]{Title of Your Book}\par<br>
\style[options]{Subtitle}\par<br>
\style[options]{Author Name}\par<br>
\vfill<br>
\style[options]{publisher identification}\par
</code></p>
<p> The <code>\vfill</code> command places as much vertical space as needed,
so that material above/below is pushed to the page top/bottom.</p>
<p>Unless your jurisdiction requires it, you do not need a publisher
identification here. Simply omit it. Professional publishers put their
business name, business logo, city and state/nation, and possibly year.
<p>Remember that the print and distribution service is NOT the publisher.
You are! Novelette does not allow inline images, so if you have a logo image,
you cannot place it between text here.</p>
</div>


<a id="copyright"></a>
<div>
<h3>Copyright Page</h3>
<p>Nowadays, popular fiction (especially print-on-demand) rarely has a block
of library catalog information. This is because such books are rarely stocked
by libraries; if stocked, they are placed by genre and author surname, instead
of by catalog call number. Even professional publishers will sometimes say
that library catalog information is shown on the publisher's web site,
rather than printed here in the book. If you do have library catalog information,
and wish to print it here, it must be in a specific format. That is beyond
the scope of Novelette.</p>
<p>The simplest Copyright Page format uses centered text, with extra space
at the top rather than at the bottom. However you do it, the Copyright Page
must be have a different format than main text. Although you may use the
<code>\style</code> command, it is inappropriate, because the page should
be readable without drawing attention to itself.</p>
<p>Sample Copyright Page:</p>
<p class="code"><code>\begin{display}<br>
\vfill<br>
\begin{center}<br>
Title of Your Book : Book Subtitle / Author Name\par<br>
Copyright ©\lnum{YYYY} Your Real Name. All Rights Reserved.\par<br>
This is a work of fiction, etc.\par<br>
Publisher contact information.\par<br>
ISBN \lnum{...}\par<br>
\end{center}<br>
\end{display}
</code></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line should be narrower than full text width. Do not allow
hyphenation at line breaks. Manually break lines using <code>\\</code> where
needed.</li>
<li>The <i>Title : Subtitle / Author</i> format is standard. You may break
it into two or more lines. Do not break words.</li> 
<li>If you use a pseudonym as author, it is best to use your real name as
copyright holder.</li>
<li>Use the copyright symbol © NOT (c). Do not use "copyleft" or anything
that implies the book is free.</li>
<li>The minimal "All Rights Reserved" may be expanded with various warnings
and imprecations.</li>
<li>It is customary, perhaps necessary, to include a disclaimer regarding fiction.
See other books for examples.</li>
<li>You are the publisher. How much contact information do you wish to write?
Unless your jurisdiction requires it, better not put your name, address, and
phone number. Most print distribution services allow you to put a web page
URL, either for yourself, or specific to the book. Where I live, I can simply
write "Independently Published by the Copyright Holder\\MyCity, MyState USA."</li>
<li>Unless legally required, avoid saying "Printed in (Nation)" or
"Printed on Thus-and-Such Paper". You have no control of where it will be
printed, or how. The Impressum (which has that information) will be added
by the printer, at time of printing, on the final verso page. If in doubt,
check with the print distribution service.</li>
<li>Sometimes, short acknowledgements appear on the copyright page.</li> 
</ul>
</div>


<a id="visualbarrier"></a>
<div>
<h3>Visual Barrier</h3>
<p>The <i>visual barrier</i> is not a standard publishing term. It is my own
term for "whatever you put on page v".</p>
<p>After the copyright on page iv, many books do not have anything else
to say, before the story begins. But it is visually distracting to place the
legalese copyright facing the first page of your story. It ruins the mood.</p>
<p>So, page v is a visual barrier. Then page vi is blank, so that your
story begins with recto page 1.</p>
<p>Page v is not blank. It might contain any one of these, but may not
contain anything that is part of the story itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#dedication">Dedication</a></li>
<li><a href="#epigraph">Epigraph</a></li>
<li><a href="#authorsnote">Author's Note</a></li>
<li><a href="#halfrepeat">Repeat of Half Title</a></li>
</ul>


<a id="dedication"></a>
<div>
<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p>Your book does not need a Dedication. That is a leftover from the era when
poor writers dedicated their books to rich folks, in hopes of benefits.
But if you insist on a Dedication, it might look like this:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\begin{display}<br>
\begin{center}<br>
\vfil<br>
\desc\ital{For Joanna}\par<br>
\null\null<br>
\vfil<br>
\end{center}<br>
\end{display}
</code></p>
<p>Two or more <code>\vfil</code> commands (just one <code>l</code>), when
used on the same page, evenly split the remaining vertical space.</p>
<p>The <code>\desc</code> command prints its text slightly larger than
main text, and <code>\ital</code> makes it Italic (this is standard).
The <code>\null\null</code> (blank lines) have the effect of moving the text
slightly above mid-page, which is visually pleasing.</p>
<p>A Dedication is always very short, and does not say "Dedicated to".
If you have more to say, put it in the form of an Author's Note.</p>
</div>


<a id="epigraph"></a>
<div>
<h3>Epigraph</h3>
<p>An Epigraph is a short piece of prose or poetry. It is meant to set
the tone of the book, or get the reader in the mood, or create the impression
that the genre or writing style is like that of the Epigraph.</p>
<p>You cannot quote someone else without written permission, which you will
not get. Commercial authors quote each other, because their common publisher
fixes it. So an Epigraph should either be something from Public Domain,
or your own writing (possibly created just for this purpose).</p>
<p>Pretentious writers like to quote Shakespeare or the King James Bible.
The works of authors such as Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo are in Public
Domain, so you could pick a line or two from one of them.</p>
<p>But an Epigraph does not have to be pretentious. Suppose your book is
about mutant spiders brought to Earth by a hail of meteorites. Here is an
Epigraph that is suited to the theme:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\begin{display}<br>
\begin{blockindent}[3]<br>
\noindent The itsy-bitsy spider\\<br>
Went up the water spout.\\<br>
Down came the rain, and\\<br>
Washed the spider out.\par<br>
\end{blockindent}<br>
\end{display}
</code></p>
</div>


<a id="authorsnote"></a>
<div>
<h3>Author's Note</h3>
<p>An Author's Note is a short (one page, at most two) explanation by the
author, directly addressing the reader. There is no particular content.
But it must lead into the story, not lead away from it. This is not the place
to discuss how your primal scream therapist recommended you write a book.</p>
<p>Informal acknowledgements might go here. If there is something the reader
ought to know (but might not know), it may be mentioned, for better
understanding of the story. One American humorist likes to mention that some
aspect of the story (surely that could never happen) actually happened.</p>
<p>In most cases, an Author's Note is formatted like a short chapter,
with an opening instead of a display page. Here is an example of a fictional
Author's Note, in which the author pretends that the story is something
his father found:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\begin{opening}<br>
\null\null\null\null\null<br>
\name{Author's Note}<br>
\null\null\null\null\null<br>
\end{opening}<br>
Shortly after the Great War, my father was on an expedition investigating
some ancient tombs that had been unearthed by cannon fire. Among the usual
detritus were several manuscripts, one of which was very unlike the others.
Professor Zorkle Dondles, of West Erewhon University, translated... etc.\par
</code></p>
<p>The above example is on the edge between "about the book" and
"part of the story". But as long as it pretends to be about the book, and
the reader will know that it is fictional, it can go in frontmatter.</p>
</div>


<a id="halfrepeat"></a>
<div>
<h3>Repeat of Half-Title</h3>
<p>Sometimes, even professionl authors have nothing to say. Let's get to the
story! No more diversions! In this case, page v may simply be a repeat of
the <a href="#halftitle">halftitle</a> page.</p>
</div>


<a id="notfrontmatter"></a>
<div>
<h3>Not Frontmatter</h3>
<p>If a map or diagram precedes the story text, the map or diagram is part of
the story itself. It is not frontmatter. You could place it recto as Page 1,
so the story text begins on Page 3. Or you could place it verso as Page 2,
facing the story text on page 3. If the map is page 2, then something else
needs to be Page 1. That could be a repeat of the halftitle, or Part I, or an
Epigraph that is extracted from the story (not from an external source).</p>
<p>If your book is divided into parts, the page announcing Part I is not
considered to be front matter. It would be the first page of mainmatter.</p>
<p>If your fontmatter is lengthy (don't do it!) then it is customary to
repeat the halftitle page, but in this case it would not be frontmatter.
It would be the first page of mainmatter.</p>
