LANGUAGE

Important: Other document classes use different methods for specifying
language. Disregard anything you read elsewhere!

When Novelette loads a language, it ONLY loads a hyphenation pattern.
There is no spelling or grammar check. There is no automatic styling
of time and date, or chapters, or anything else. Do it yourself!

Novelette uses this command in Preamble:
	\setlang{code}
Notice that it is NOT \language or \lang or \setlanguage.
If you do not use \setlang, the default language is english. See note 1.

There is a limited list of available language codes. You may set only one.
Here are your choices:
	english usenglishmax british (note 1)
	german ngerman swissgerman german-x-latest ngerman-x-latest (note 2)
	norwegian bokmal nynorsk (note 3)
	french (note 4)
    occitan spanish portutuese italian latin
	basque finnish danish icelandic swedish
	dutch (note 5)
	catalan (note 6)
	welsh (note 7)
Most languages use the same hyphenation, regardless of regional differences
in vocabulary or pronunciation. That is why there are no separate codes for
Australian English, Canadian French, etc.


NOTES:
	1. "english" is the default. It uses an out-of-date hyphenation pattern.
Better results will be obtained by "usenglishmax" or "british".
	2. "german" is 1901, "ngerman" is 1996. "swissgerman" is Swiss.
"german-x-latest" and "ngerman-x-latest" are recent updates to the 1901
and 1996 patterns.
	3. "norwegian" uses bokmal. "bokmal" and "nynorsk" are specific. 
	4. "french" does not load spacing patterns, just hyphenantion. Add the
command \frenchspacing after \begin{document}, to increase the space between
sentences. But for increased punctuation space, you must type it yourself.
	5. Digraphs IJ and ij may not be used in title or author. You may type
the two separate letters.
	6. Single-character Ldot and ldot may not be used in title or author.
Atually, you should not use them anywhere. Use middot when necessary.
	7. Ycircumflex and y circumflex may not be used in title or author.
You may not use W or w with any diatritical mark, in title or author.


You cannot load the `lipsum' package. If you need some text for
testing layout, the built-in \fillertext command may be used in the
document body. You may not use \fillertext in final mode.
