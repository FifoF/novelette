<h3>What is mainmatter ?</h3>
<p>Main Matter, or <i>mainmatter</i>, is your story. It includes chapters,
prologue, epilogue, maps, and so forth. It may include an Introduction,
if that is part of your story.</p>
<p>Mainmatter begins on recto Page 1. In most cases, that is where the
story's written text begins, regardless of whether it is a chapter or
something else. But there are exceptions:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>If you have one or more maps on pages preceding the text, they are
mainmatter. By the time the reader arrives at the opening text, the page
is an odd number higher than 1.</li>
<li>If frontmatter is lengthy (don't do it), then it is customary to place
a second halftitle page as the beginning of mainmatter, page 1. The opening
text will have an odd page number, higher than 1.</li>
<li>If the story is divided into parts, Page 1 is the the display page
announcing Part I. The story text will begin on an odd page higher than 1.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Here is a model for the first chapter, assumed to begin at Page 1.
 Each of its commands is a hyperlink within this documentation. Click to learn
what the commands do, and how to choose their values.</p>
<p>The <code>\null</code> command inserts a blank line. May be repeated.
Actual mainmatter opening pages will often have many <code>\null</code> to
provide space at the top of the page, or between items on the page.</p>

<div>
<h3>\mainmatter</h3>
<p>The <code>\mainmatter</code> command defines the start of mainmatter.
It clears to a recto page. It re-starts page numbers at arabic 1. Whether
or not the page number is printed, depends on layout style.</p>
</div>


<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h3>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and can also be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">\desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>To vertically position items, use the <i>\null</i> command,
as often as necessary, to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>


<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name[option]{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h3>
<p>The \name command  may only be used
within the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number. This is not intended for more than
one line of text.</p>
<p>The name text is pre-set at 1.8 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>


<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\desc[option]{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h3>
<p>The \desc command may only be used in an <a href="#opening">opening</a>
environment. If used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text. If necessary, you may use
\desc more than once, for multiple lines. However, multiple lines would
probably look better in ordinary main text.</p>
<p>The desc text is pre-set at 1.33 times the size of main text.</p>
<p>The option is a letter: l c r o i, for alignment left, center, right,
outside, or inside.</p>
</div>


<a id="init"></a>
<div>
<h3>\init[kern]{letter}{letters}</h3>
<p>The <code>\init</code> command is optional. But if you use it for one
chapter, you must uniformly use it for all of them.</p>
<p>It is customary to use something distinctive for the very first line
of chapter text. Drop caps are out of fashion, and never were widely used for
popular fiction, so Novelette does not do them.</p>
<p>The single <i>letter</i> argument is the first letter of the chapter text.
If text begins with quotation marks, you may include them. This letter will
be set larger than normal, so it is distinctive. It does not affect the
line grid.</p>
<p>The plural <i>letters</i> are letters, perhaps a few words, that will be
set with lowercase converted to small caps. Note that the <i>letter</i>
argument already placed a letter, so do not repeat it in the <i>letters</i>.</p>
<p>After this, text is normal. Example:</p>
<p class="code">\init{I}{t was dark and stormy,} but that was not unusual.</code></p>
<p>The optional <i>kern</i> will adjust the spacing between the enlarged
letter, and the following small caps letter. It is a number, without units.
Negative number moves them closer, positive farther. Rarely beyond -.2 to .2
range. Useful when the first letter is T, so you can move the following letter
partly under the overhang.</p>
<p>If you want the first letter to be something decorative, then you will
need to use <i>fontspec</i> syntax to define your own font command, and
use it there. Novelette will not do that for you; do it yourself.</p>
</div>


<a id="scene"></a>
<h3>\scene{<i>text</i>}</h3>
<p>The <code>\scene</code> command creates a scene break. If all you want is
a simple blank line, use <code>\null</code> instead.</p>
<p>The <i>text</i> has several variations:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>\scene{-} skips one line, and puts a long dash (about one-fourth width)
in the gap</li>
<li>\scene{*} skips one line, and puts three widely-spaced asterisks in the gap.</li>
<li>\scene{text} (where text is neither - nor *) skips TWO lines, and puts the
text left-aligned in the gap. The text is slightly larger than main text.
It is off-grid, but this is visually best.</li>
<li>\scene{-text} (first character is hyphen) is like the above, except that
the text begins with a long dash, with the first letter at indent. If your
chapters are routinely divided into scenes, this method is especially attractive.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>If you use a blank line instead of <code>\scene</code>, there may be pages
where the blank line is at top or bottom. Standard practice is to use
<code>\scene{-}</code> or <code>\scene{*}</code> to show that the missing line
was intentional.</p>
<p>In all cases, it is bad layout to have just one line above or below a
scene break. The only solution is to re-write.</p>
