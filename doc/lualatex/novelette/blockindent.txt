BLOCK INDENT

You may indent one or more entire paragraphs:
	\begin{blockindent}[L,R]
		Stuff to be indented.\par
		More stuff to be indented.\par
	\end{blockindent}
L and R are integers (not decimal). They are multiples of the normal
first-line paragraph indent. L indents at left, R indents at right.
	You may simply write L if you only need a left indent.
Default block indent is L=1.

Within the blockindent, the first line of paragraphs "should" be automatically
indented in the usual fashion. You may control this by writing \indent or
\noindent at the start of the first line. But if that fails, you may use
\forceindent or \backindent to over-ride whatever TeX used.

Note that a symmetrical blockindent is not the same as center. With center,
each line may (and probably will) have a different width. With blockindent,
the left and right paragraph edges are vertically aligned.

You may use something like this:
	\begin{blockindent}[3,3]
    \begin{center}
    Stuff goes here.\par
    \end{center}
    \end{blockindent}
That provides centered text (variable line width) confined to a block that
is narrower than the full textwidth. It is usually better than using
center by itself.
