Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress, as of late February 2023. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change. Thus, no documentation yet.
Power users can get a glimpse of what Novelette will do, by looking into
the code.

Expected release mid-April 2023. Before I release it, I must wait for
2023 binaries on my platform. They are custom-built, beyond my control.

UPDATE, April 11, 2023: Settings \layout{headgap= ,footgap= } have been
combined into a single \layout{gap= }.

UPDATE, April 10, 2023: Fixed some typos in the html (Thanks!). Implemented
some experimental code changes. The experiments work for me, but because
they are quite radical, more testing is needed. If they withstand the tests,
potential users will be so happy! Swainson fonts will not be part of the
release (not really necessary). If you have their preliminary files,
please delete them (unfinished).
