<h2>Novelette - Documentation</h2>

<h2>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h2>


<p>Document class <i>novelette</i> is unlike any other LaTeX document class:
(a) It requires LuaLaTeX; (b) It does not honor widely-used LaTeX commands;
(c) It has its own methods for setting layout and other properties,
specifically written for those who have very little knowledge of LaTeX;
(d) The resulting PDF is created for printed (to paper) popular fiction,
such as detective novels, printed in black ink only; (e) There is no capability
for Ebooks or any kind of academic works.</p> 

<p>QUICK START: Here is a model document template. Each of its commands is a
hyperlink within this documentation. Click to learn what the commands do,
and how to choose their values:</p>

</div>


<a id="lualatex"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". Some GUI programs (TeXworks, TeXstudio, etc.)
can read this line. It tells them to use <i>lualatex</i> compiler, regardless
of what the program uses for its standard compiler.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, be sure to use </i>lualatex</i>.
Anything else will be rejected.</p>
</div>

<a id="utf-8"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". It tells some GUI programs that the characters
have utf-8 encoding. You must type your document using utf-8, without its
"byte order mark" (BOM). This is essential. It is the default encoding for
Linux and Mac. On Windows, be sure to configure your text editor for
utf-8 without BOM.</p>
</div>

<a id="documentclass"></a>
<div>
<h3>\documentclass{novelette}</h3>
<p>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette has no class options.
Anything you need is set by one of the other commands in Preamble,
or is automatically calculated from other settings.</p>
</div>

<a id="mode"></a>
<div>
<h3>\mode{<i>choose</i>}</h3>
<p>Novelette has four modes: draft, shade, align, final. If you do not set
the mode, its default is draft.</p>
<p><b>draft</b> disables PDF/X conformance (see <a href="#intent">intent</a>).
It places DRAFT at the top left of each page. The PDF title is changed,
to include the word DRAFT. Otherwise, the layout, line breaks, and page breaks
are the same as they will be, when you graduate to final mode.</p>
<p><b>shade</b> is draft mode, with margins tinted gray.</p>
<p><b>align</b> is shade/draft mode, with text baselines marked.</p>
<p><b>final</b> should only be used when you are ready. In final mode,
Novelette performs some checks that it would otherwise omit (to save time).
If your document fails one of the checks, you will be warned. Then itt will
automatically revert to draft mode, so that the PDF cannot be confused with
the final file.</p>
</div>

<a id="intent"></a>
<div>
<h3>\intent{<i>choose</i>}</h3>
<p>There are four intents: none, SWOP, FOGRA39, JC200103. Default is none.</p>
<p>No matter which intent you choose, fonts are subset embedded. That is enough
for some print services. But many print services require PDF/X conformance,
especially <span style="white-space:nowrap">PDF/X-1a:2001.</span></p>
<p>When a file conforms to PDF/X, it must have a certain internal structure.
Among the requirements is an "output intent", which states that the PDF was
prepared according to the requirements of a particular print technology.
It does not force the printer to use that technology.</p>
<p>Your file will be printed by an industrial-strength photocopier or inkjet,
rather than the offset presses declared by intent. In any case, the intent is
irrelevant for books using only black ink. Nevertheless, an intent must be
declared, even though it is useless; it is part of the PDF/X standards.</p>
<p>You are urged to use an intent, other than <i>none</i>, for the final PDF.
This enables additional checks, hopefully reducing the possibility that your
file will be rejected by the print service.</p>
<p><b>none</b> does not produce PDF/X. No matter how you set intent, it will
automatically be changed to <i>none</i> unless you are in final mode.</p>
<p><b>SWOP</b> means "US Web Coated SWOP". This is most frequently used in
the United States.</p>
<p><b>FOGRA39</b> (actually FOGRA39L) is frequently used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>JC200103</b> is frequently used in Japan.</p>
</div>

<a id="setlang"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setlang{<i>code</i>}</h3>
<p>This command sets the language hyphenation pattern. Only one language
may be chosen, from a <a href="#langlist">list</a>. It does not set anything
other than hyphenation.</p>
<p>You may write some text in another language; but if you do, it will be
hyphenated according to the rules chosen by <i>\setlang</i>.</p>
</div>

<a id="title"></a>
<div>
<h3>\title{<i>Title of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>When you use a print-on-demand service, you will provide the book title.
This </i>\title</i> must be exactly the same. Also, it must be the same
on the printed title page, on the copyright page, in page headers (if you use
them), and generally anywhere the title is expected. Novelette does not do
cover artwork, but the cover must have exactly the same title.</p>
<p>The title must use the Latin character sets. Some print services limit
to Latin-1; others allow more extended Latin characters. Curly apostrophe
and curly quotes are not Latin characters, but Novelette will convert them
to the acceptable straight variety.</p>

<a id="author"></a>
<div>
<h3>\author{<i>Author of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>The considerations for <i>\title</i> apply, with these additional:</p>
<p>Novelette is not intended for academic works. There should be a single
author (in some cases, two equal authors, using a single <i>\author</i>).</p>
<p>Whether the author is your real name, or a pseudonym, is up to you.
If in doubt, ask the print service.</p>
<p>If you use a pseudonym, then you should probably use your real name as
copyright holder, on the copyright page. Then, if someone unlawfully copies
your book, it will be easier to enforce the copyright. Otherwise, you will
have to prove that "Fakename Author" is actually "Realname You" before
distributors will honor your requests.</p>
<p>And, if you do use a pseudonym, request that distributors (and libraries)
have it indexed under the desired name (pseudonym or real name).</p>

<a id="trimsize"></a>
<div>
<h3>\trimsize{width=<i>W</i>,height=<i>H</i>}</h3>
<p>Trim Size is the size of your book pages. Be sure to choose cream paper
(creme, off-white), not white paper. The print service will offer a choice
of several standard sizes.</p>
<p>Dimensions <i>W</i> and <i>H</i> are measured in units of inches or
millimeters (in,mm). Examples:<p>
<p>\trimsize{5.5in,8.5in} % American Digest.</p>
<p>\trimsize{width=129mm,height=198mm} % British B-Format.</p>
<p>The name "trim size" comes from the manufacturing process. The pages are
printed on larger paper, then roughly cut and assembled with glue.
The cover is attached with glue, then the entire book is "trimmed" with
a cutting device. This is why such books have all page edges aligned.</p>
<p>In the case of library hardcover books, trim size refers to the interior
pages. The cover size is slightly larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="sheetfeed"></a>
<div>
<h3>\sheetfeed{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>Do not use the \sheetfeed setting, unless you are certain that you need it.
If you use this setting incorrectly, big problems will result. Do not guess.
Available choices are <i>letter</i> and <i>A4</i>.</p>
<p><b>If you do not use \sheetfeed, the PDF page size will be the same as the
book trim size. This is how nearly all print-on-demand services want it.</p>
<p><b>letter</b> centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally, in the
larger USletter size (8.5in width, 11in height),</p>
<p><b>A4</b> (or a4) centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally,
in the larger European A4 size (210mm width, 297mm height).</p>
<p>If you are printing pages at home, for manual editing, then you might
use letter or A4, to produce a consistent result from your home printer.
That might also be the case, if your book will be reviewed by an editor.</p>
<p>Novelette does not produce crop marks or trim marks. It does write the
internal "TrimBox" metadata to the PDF.</p>
</div>

<a id="margins"></a>
<div>
<h3>\margins{top=<i>T</i>,outside=<i>O</i>,bottom=<i>B</i>,inside=<i>I</i>}</h3>
<p>In Novelette, margins surround the printable area. Nothing may be printed
within the margins. The header, main text, and footer all must fit within the
rectangle surrounded by the margins. This is how the term "margins" is used
by most print services.</p>
<p>Word processors usually place header within the top margin, and footer
within the bottom margin.</p>
<p>Margins are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm). It is best
to use the same units for margins, as you use for trim size.</p>
<p><b>top</b> margin is the area above the topmost printable item, which
is the header (if your page style uses header), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>outside</b> margin is the area at the outer page edge, being the left
side of even-numbered (verso) pages, or the right side of odd-numbered (recto)
pages.</p>
<p><b>bottom</b> margin is the area below the lowest printable item, which
is the footer (if your page layout uses footer), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>inside</b> margin as at the spine (binding). In general, this margin
should be set 0.125in (or 3mm) wider than the ouside margin. The extra width
allows for binding glue.</p>
<p>You may abbreviate the margins setting, with a single value:<br>
\margins{<i>size</i>} sets top, ouside, and bottom margins to that size.
Inside margin is set 0.125in (or 3mm) larger.</p>
<p>If you do not set margins, Novelette will set them for you. At smaller
trim sizes, the margins will be at the minimum required by print services.
At larger trim size, the margins will be larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="design"></a>
<div>
<h3>\design</a>{fontsize=<i>M</i>,lines=<i>L</i>,style=<i>S</i>,headgap=<i>H</i>,footgap=<i>F</i>}</h3>
<p>This setting determines page layout. In Novelette, you do not set either the
font size, or the leading (baselineskip). Instead, they are automatically
calculated from the trim size, margins, and design.</p>
<p><b>fontsize</b> is the size of main body text, with units pt (TeX points)
or bp (PostScript points). The value may be integer or decimal. Typical value
is 11.6pt. Run a test document and look at the log Summary. It will tell you
the estimated average characters per line. Best readability is somewhere near
65 characters. This number is inversely proportional to font size.</p>
<p><b>lines</b>is the integer number of lines in the main text block. It does
not count header or footer. Default value varies, based on other setings.</p>
<p><b>style</b> is an integer from 1 to 7. It determines whether page layout
has header and/or footer, and determines alignment of header content.
Other document classes require you to write code for the style. Novelette does
that for you.</p>
<p>The default style depends on how much vertical room is available, based on
other settings. If enough room, default is 2. If not enough room, 4.</p>
<p><b>style=1</b> provides only footer. Page number centered in footer.</p>
<p><b>style=2</b> provides header and footer. Page number centered in footer.
Text centered in header.</p>
<p><b>style=3</b> provides header and footer. Page number in footer,
aligned to outside margin. Text in header, aligned to outside margin.</p>
<p><b>style=4</b> provides only header. Page number at outside margin.
Text centered.</p>
<p><b>style=5</b> is like 4. Adds a vertical bar near the page number,
at fixed distance from the outside margin.</p>
<p><b>style=6</b> is like 4. Adds a slash next to the page number.</p>
<p><b>style=7</b> provides only header. Page number and text are centered,
separated by slash. Page number is toward the outside.</p>
<p><b>headgap</b> is a number (integer or decimal) from 0 to 1. It defines
how much of a "gap" appears between the header and the top of main text.
Value 0 is rarely useful. Value 1 skips a whole line, and is best for the
large book sizes. Value 0.5 is a nice compromise for smaller books.</p>
<p><b>footgap</b> works like headgap, except it applies between main text
and footer.</p>
<p>If your design has both header and footer, it is best to set headgap and
footgap at the same value. But this is not required.</p> 
</div>

<a id="setfont"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setfont{<i>role</i>}{<i>font name</i>}[<i>features</i>]</h3>
<p>Novelette uses <i>fontspec</i> technology for Open Type fonts. If you are
a knowledgeable LaTeX user, you may use some aspects of <i>fontspec</i>
directly. However, do not use <i>\setmainfont</i>.</p>
<p><i>\setfont</i> has two mandatory arguments, and an optional argument.</p>
<p><b>role</b> is a keyword: <i>main head note name desc deco alt</i>.
It assigns the font to its proper place and purpose.</p>
<p><b>font name</b> is the Open Type font family name. Examples are Swainson,
EB Garamond, Libertinus Serif. No TeX fonts with three-letter codes.</p>
<p><b>features</b> is an optional, comma-separated list of Open Type features,
using <i>fontspec</i> syntax.</p>
<p><b>main</b> role is equivlanet to <i>\setmainfont</i>. The font and features
will be used for main body text.</p>
<p><b>head</b> is applied to only the header and footer. In many cases,
this is the same as the main font, except do not use ligatures. You might
prefer to use Scale=N where N is a number slightly less than 1.</p>
<p><b>note</b> is used for <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a>. It is almost
always the same as main font, except with Scale less than 1.</p>
<p><b>name</b> is the font used by the <a href="#name">\name</a> command,
in the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. It may be the
same as the main font, but at larger Scale. Or you may use a stylish font.</p>
<p><b>desc</b> is the font used by the <a href="#desc">\desc</a> command,
in the <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment. It is usually the same
as the main font, but at larger Scale.</p>
<p><b>deco</b> is a font providing unusual characters such as dingbats,
flourishes, or unusually-shaped characters.</p>
<p><b>alt</b> is a font providing characters that cannot be found in the
main text font.</p>
</div>

<a id="openings"></a>
<div>
<h3>\openings{top=T,height=H,align=A}</h3>
<p>The <a href="#opening">opening</a> environment begins such things as
chapters. The <i>\openings</i> comand defines the style.</p>
<p><b>top</b> T is an integer, number of lines from top of ordinary main
text block. It is the baseline position of the highest text in an
<a href="#opening>opening</a>.</p>
<p><b>height</b> H is an integer, number of lines from top of ordinary main
text block. It is the baseline position of the first line of main text,
folowing the <a href="#opening">opening</a>.</p>
<p><b>align</b> A is a keyword: left, right, center, inside, outside.
It sets the default alignment of items in an <a href="#opening">opening</a></p>
<p>Note that top and height are not enforced. All these do is place markers
in the side margins, at the expected vertical positions. Whether or not
these markers are honored, is up to you.</p>
</div>

<a id="opening"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{opening} ... \end{opening}</h3>
<p>The <i>opening</i> environment is used at the start of new chapters,
and canalos be used at the start of chapter-like portions of your book.
It does not matter whether the portion is just one page.</p>
<p>Within an opening, you may use some commands that are not available
in main text. These are <a href="#name">\name</a> and
<a href="#desc">desc</a> (description). In essence, those are chapter
title and subtitle (if any).</p>
<p>The <a href="#openings">\openings</a> command determines the default
alignment of items within an opening. It also places markers. To vertically
position items, use the <i>\null</i> command, as often as necessary,
to insert blank lines.</p>
</div>

<a id="name"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name{<i>Chapter Title or Number</i>}</h3>
<p>The content of <i>\name</i> will use whatever font and features you set
via <a href="#setfont">\setfont{name}{...}[...]</a>. It may only be used
within the <a href="#opening>opening</a> environment. The <i>name</i>
is usually chapter title or number.</p>
</div>

<a id="desc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\name{<i>Chapter Subtitle</i>}</h3>
<p>The content of <i>\desc</i> will use whatever font and features you set
via <a href="#setfont">\setfont{desc}{...}[...]</a>. It may only be used
within the <a href="#opening>opening</a> environment. The <i>desc</i>
(description), if used, is usually a one-line chapter subtitle. This is
not intended for an extended amount of text.</p>
