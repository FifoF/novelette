FONTS

Novelette uses only utf-8 character encoding. Fonts are handled by the
fontspec package, which is loaded automatically. You must use Open Type fonts,
or in some cases TrueType fonts. Never use the older TeX Type 1 fonts,
or any other technology.

Novelette uses its own \setfont command:
	\setfont{main}{Font Name}[features]
	\setfont{deco}{Font Name}[features]
The main font is set only once, in Preamble. Do not use \setmainfont.
	If you do not set the main font, a default will be chosen. If you attempt
to set a font that is not installed where TeX can find it, a default will
be chosen, and a warning is issued. If no suitable default is found, error.
	The main font is used for main body text. With certain automatic
modifications (such as Scale) it is used in header/footer, footnotes,
and opening name/desc.
	The deco font may be used on the book title and half-title pages,
for dramatic effect. If may also be used on a "Part" separator page.
If you do not set the deco font, it will be the main font, with modifications.
The deco font is used like this:
	{\decofont Decorative Text}

If you are familiar with fontspec syntax, you may define and use your own
fonts. This is discouraged. There are potential layout issues that may
arise when using font commands. They are not bugs; they are font mis-use.

Novelette uses Libertinus Serif as an alternative font.
It may be installed as package 'libertinus-fonts'. If you need characters
that are not in the chosen main font, you may request them from the altfont.
For example, suppose the main font has no Greek letters, but you need pi,
which is Unicode hex 0030. Sample code:
	I want my {\altfont ^^^^0030}, and I want it now.
Libertinus Serif is a moderately-designed font, which is likely to be
unobtrusive when an occasional character is interted within main text.
It is automatically scaled to fit its surroundings.
