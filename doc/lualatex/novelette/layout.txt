LAYOUT

\trimsize{width=W,height=H}
	W and H are measured in units of in or mm.

\margins{top=T,outside=O,bottom=B,inside=I}
	T, O, B, I are measured in units of in or mm.
	Inside means at the spine (binding). Usually larger than the others.

\design{fontsize=M,lines=L,style=S,headgap=H,footgap=F,opening=O}
	M is the main font size, with units pt|bp.
	L is integer lines per page, main body text (not counting header/footer).
	S is integer style number, which sets whether running-body pages
have header/footer/both, and the position of items in the header.
	H and F adjust the vertical space between header/body and body/footer.
	O is l|c|r for the alignment if items in an opening.

\guides{integer,integer}
	Guides appear in the side margins, when mode is shade or align. If unset,
there are no guides.
	You may use just one, or two comma-separated guide integers. The value
is the number of main text lines, from top of main text, where the guide
will be placed at baseline. For example, \guides{6,12} places them at the
sixth and twelfth baselines of main text. 
	Guides are useful for showing standard heights for the topmost content
of an opening (usually its name), and the first line of main text beneath
the opening.
	Guides are not enforced. You decide whether or not to position anything
relative to the guides.
	Once set, guides may not be changed.

Note that Novelette does not have a setting for leading (baseline skip).
It is calculated from other settings.

There are a few other settings that serve special purposes (TO DO).
