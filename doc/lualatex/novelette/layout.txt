LAYOUT

\layout(style=integer,gap=number,scale=number}

style
	The style is an integer from 1 to 7. Each style selects the layout
of header and/or footer from a menu of styles.

gap
	Number integer|decimal 0-1. This is the extra gap between the
header|footer and main text. Value 0 is rare. Value 1 is good for
medium-large books. Value 0.5 is compromise for small-medium books.

scale
	Number from 0.75 to 1. Scale of header/footer text, relative to main text.
