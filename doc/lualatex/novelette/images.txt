IMAGES

Novelette images must be monochrome black/white png format, at 1-bit per pixel.
The image must be stripped of private metadata such as EXIF. 

If not in final mode, Novelette allows "fake" images. These are drawn, gray
rectangles. Width is half the textwidth. Height is an integer, indicating
the number of text lines that the fake image displaces. Using fake images
allows you to "write now, do graphics later." The log Summary will tell you
what real image sizes (pixels at 600ppi) correspond to fake images.


IMAGE COMMAND

Novelette does not use \includegraphics or any other standard TeX command
for image insertion. It uses a custom \image command, real and fake:
	\image[placement]{filename.png}
	\image[placement]{integer}
Bottom of image, real or fake, is at text baseline.

If not specified, horizontal placement within an opening defaults to
the \layout{openings=value}. It defaults to c (center) otherwise.

If not specified, vertical placement defaults to h (here), as explained below.

If specified, placement may contain a horizontal value, a vertical value,
or both. Does not matter if space or comma is present. Error if conflicting
values of the same type.

The placement may contain at most one of l,c,r,o,i for horizontal alignment:
	l -> left-aligned
	c -> horizontally centered
	r -> right-aligned
	o -> outside aligned (left of verso, right of recto)
	i -> inside aligned (right of verso, left of recto)

The placement may contain at most one of h,t,b,p for vertical insertion
relative to the flow of main text. These are "similar to, but different from"
standard LaTeX float definitions:
	h -> Place image "here" where the \image command is written, anywhere on
		 the page. But if it cannot fit, move it to the top of the following
		 page. Main text will flow to fill the lines left behind.
		 If you do not wish text to flow, use \clearpage to break pages.
	t -> Place image at "top" of the page where command is written, which
		 is usually above the command. In some cases, if the command is too
		 late, or if other material is at the top, then the image is moved
		 to the top of the following page.
	b -> Place image at "bottom" of the page where command is written.
		 If it cannot fit there, place it at bottom of following page.
	p -> Place image on a page by itself.
The \image command must occupy its own paragraph. The bottom of the image
will be at text baseline.
	Novelette only adds enough whitespace, above or below an image,
to maintain the text line grid. If you need more whitespace, you may insert
the \null command above|below the image, to create blank lines. Or, recreate
the image with its own whitespace included.
	There is no capability for a border. If you need one, draw it within the
image itself.
	There is no caption command. If necessary, draw the text within the
image itself. Beware of using fine-detail fonts within low-resolution images.


FAKE IMAGE

Write first, do graphics later! Novelette allows you to place fake images.
Fake images may not be used in final mode: an error results.
	\image[placement]{integer}
The \image command accepts an integer instead of a filename.
It will place a gray rectangle occupying that many lines height. Width is
half the text width.
	Look in the log Summary, to see what actual image sizes are needed.


IMAGE VALIDATION

Fake images cannot be used in final mode. An error results.

In all modes, Novelette verifies that any real image is monochrome png.
If not, there will be an error in final mode, or a warning in other modes.

In final mode, novelette also verifies that each image has been stripped
of private metadata. If not, an error results.

It is easy to ensure that an image will pass validation. Use your favorite
graphics program, plus either ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick command line tool:
	1. Create the image in any graphics program.
	2. Within the graphics program, convert the image to black/white only.
	   This might be accomplished using a "threshold" or "1-bit" method.
	3. Export the image as png format. You do not need to worry about
	   the details, because the next step will fix them for you.
	4. Fix the png, to ensure it is 1-bit monochrome without private metadata:
			ImageMagick:  magick mogrify -monochrome -strip filename.png
			GraphicsMagick: gm mogrify -monochrome -strip filename.png


PURPOSE OF VALIDATION

Not all print services require validated images. Your own home printer, and
office printers, do not care. But commercial printers prefer that either
images be dumbed-down for dumbed-down printing machines, or spiced-up for
spiced-up printing machines. When in doubt, dumbed-down works. That is what
happens when the image is converted for validation. It basically says,
"Print it however you wish." There is not much that can go wrong with
1-bit monochrome. If you were working with color, that would be different.
