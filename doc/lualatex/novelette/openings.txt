OPENINGS

An "opening" is a page with special layout. New chapters begin with an opening.
Certain chapter-like portions, such as Introduction or Prologue, may use
the opening style.

\begin{opening}
\name{such as chapter number}
\desc{if used, a very short description}
\end{opening}
Main text starts here.

Command \begin{opening} begins a new page. If your page style uses headers,
there will be no header on that page.

Commands \name and \desc may only be used within the opening. They will
style the text according to \setfont{name} and \setfont{desc}.

In the Preamble, you may use this command (note plural openings):
	\openings{top=T,height=H,align=A}
T and H are integers. T is the line from top of textblock, where the baseline
of topmost opening content (usually name) should be placed. H is the line from
top of textblock, where the first line of main content should be placed.
	T and H are not enforced. You can place things where you wish. When you
use shade or align mode, markers are placed in the margins at T and H.
Then you can manually get the desired vertical positions by writing as many
\null commands (blank lines) as you need.
	Novelette default values for T and H are calculated, based on other
settings.
	A is the horizontal alignment of material in the opening.
Choices are left, center, right. Default center.

To change the defaults to your own values, use this in Preamble:
	\openings{top=T,height=H,align=A}
Note the plural "openings".

To locally change a specific opening, write this just above \begin{opening}:
	\thisopeningstyle{top=T,height=H,align=A} %%%%% Subject to change.

The first line of main text may have special styling. A common practice is
to enlarge the first letter, and put a few words in small caps.
If you wish to do this, use the \init command:
	\init[option]{letter}{words} then ordinary text follows.
The letter is the first letter (sometimes also an opening quotation mark).
The words are placed in small caps. Be sure that the letter is not duplicated
at the start of the words.
	The option is a small number, which adjusts kerning between the letter
and the next character. For example, if the letter is T, you may be able to
place the following letter so that it partially moves under the arm of the T.
A negative number moves things closer. Typical value might be 0.2.
Do not use units, just the number. Novelette automatically uses em units.
	The enlarged first letter does not push its line downward.

There are no drop caps. Just forget about them.
