FONTS

Novelette uses only utf-8 character encoding. Fonts are handled by the
fontspec package, which is loaded automatically. You must use Open Type fonts,
or in some cases TrueType fonts. Never use the older TeX Type 1 fonts,
or any other technology.

Novelette uses its own \setfont command:
	\setfont{main}{Font Name}[features]
	\setfont{deco}{Font Name}[features]

The main font is set only once, in Preamble. Do not use \setmainfont.
	If you do not set the main font, a default will be chosen. If you attempt
to set a font that is not installed where TeX can find it, a default will
be chosen, and a warning is issued. If no suitable default is found, error.
	The main font is used for main body text. With certain automatic
modifications (such as Scale) it is used in header/footer, footnotes,
and opening name/desc.

The deco font may be used only in display pages. These are stand-alone
pages that do not need to conform to the text line grid. They are identified
by use of the display environment.
	If you do not set the deco font, it is the main font, with modifications.

If you are familiar with fontspec syntax, you may define and use your own
fonts. This is discouraged. There are potential layout issues that may
arise when using font commands. They are not bugs; they are font mis-use.

If the main font is neither EB Garamond nor Libertinus Serif, then one of
these fonts (if installed) will be designated as an alternative font.
It may be used when the main font lacks some character(s) that you need.
For example, suppose that your main font has no Greek letters. You need
Greek lowercase pi.This is the code:
	{\altfont\uni{0030}}
where 0030 is the Unicode location of pi.
