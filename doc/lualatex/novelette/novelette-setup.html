<h2>Setup</h2>


<a id="basics"></id>
<div>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Novelette requires a working TeX installation with LuaTeX and LaTeX.
It does not require much else.</p>
<p>When you install TeXlive (or MiKTeX), you need these collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential programs and files</li>
<li>LaTeX fundamental packages</li>
<li>LuaTeX packages</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a very small installation, in the TeX world. You will also need
these packages, which you may already have:</p>
<p class="code"><code>xparse xpatch xifthen xstring ifmtarg fontspec<br>
fp microtype silence changepage noindentafter</code></p>
<p>You will need hyphenation patterns for the language you will write
(you do not need them for the occasional short phrase in another language).
If you did not install the TeXlive collection for your language, you may
install only what you need. In most cases, you need package
<code>hyphen-yourlang</code> where <i>yourlang</i> is the English lowercase
name of your language (french, not françcais; italian, not italiano).
Disregard regional differences: canadien, suisse, français are all french.</p>
<p>Unless you are an advanced user who writes custom code, you do not need
to read the documentation for packages other than Novelette itself. If you
are an advanced user, you probably need the documentation for packages
<code>fontspec</code> and <code>microtype</code>.</p>
<p>In some Linux operating systems, there is no <code>lualatex</code> binary
program. Check: <code>which lualatex</code>. If it is not found, try this:
<code>which luahbtex</code>. If that is not found, then your TeX installation
is bad. Otherwise, navigate to the directory that has <code>luahbtex</code>
and command: <code>ln -s luahbtex lualatex</code></p>
</div>


<a id="reqfont"></a>
<div><h3>Required Font</h3>
<p>Although TeX uses <i>Latin Modern Roman</i> as default font, it is utterly
unsuitable for popular fiction, particularly when using print-on-demand.
You will need to use a different font.</p>
<p>Novelette expects that you have <i>Libertinus Serif</i> installed where TeX
can find it. In MiKTeX, install <code>libertinus-fonts</code>.
In TeXlive command line:</p>
<p class="code"><code>tlmgr install libertinus-fonts</code></p>
<p>Note that other packages with <i>libertinus</i> in the name, are something
else. You want <i>libertinus-fonts</i>.</p>
<p>If you do not use
<a href="novelette-preamble.html#setfont"><code>\setfont</code></a>
to choose something else, Novelette will use <i>Libertinus Serif</i> as
main font. It is suited to popular fiction, although there are other fonts
that look as good (or better) for this purpose.</p>
<p>Since <i>Libertinus Serif</i> has a reasonably large character set,
Novelette uses it as "Plan B" when your chosen main font does not have a
practicular character. For example, if your chosen main font does not have
the Greek lowercase letter "pi", you can get it this way:</p>
<p class="code"><code>Pecan \altfont{\uni{03C0}} with ice cream.</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>\uni{03C0}</code> requests Unicode 03C0, which is pi.</p>
<p>If you do not choose your own main font, and do not have
<i>Libertinus Serif</i> as default, then Novelette will use <i>Latin Modern
Roman</i>. but it will issue a warning, and prevent using final mode.</p>

<h3>Your Font</h3>
<p>Novelette can use any OpenType font (extension <code>otf</code>)
and some TrueType fonts (extension <code>ttf</code>). It cannot use Type 1
fonts (extension <code>pfb, afm, pfm, vf</code>).</p>
<p>The TeX Font Catalog (online web page) shows samples of all fonts that
can be installed within TeX. However, you are not limited to those fonts.
On most platforms, Novelette can find fonts installed in the operating system,
not just the ones installed within TeX. But be sure that the fonts are
licensed for your purpose.</p>
<p>Each font must have a license that permits embedding, for printed
books, for profit. Many "free" or system fonts do not have a suitable license.
In particular, DO NOT use any font that comes with the "GNU Public License"
(GPL) unless it also has a "font exception" clause that allows embedding
for any purpose.</p>
<p>Some fonts have a free version, and a paid version. You might need the
paid version. Some fonts come with a program, and can only be used for
files created by that program. Novelette cannot verify the license; this is
your responsibilty.</p>
<p>Your print-on-demand book will be printed using a high-speed photocopier,
not offset press (unless you strike it rich). Before committing to a font,
create test files, for each <i>Font Name</i>. Select either <i>letter</i>
or <i>A4</i> depending on what size paper is used. Note that this is not
the same as your book page size:</p>
<p class="code"><code>
\documentclass{novelette}<br>
\setfont{main}{<i>Font Name</i>}<br>
\sheetfeed{<i>letter or A4</i>}<br>
\begin{document}<br>
\fillertext<br>
\end{document}
</code></p>
<p>Print the PDF on a photocopier that can print directly from digital files.
Where I live, this kind of machine is often at print/ship services. Be sure
to specify non-color print.</p>
<p>The name of the main font will be printed above the filler text. That way,
you can print several test files, and know which font is which.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to how dark the characters print. Fonts intended
for offset presses may print too light. Pay attention to the reading
experience: Does the text flow the way you expect in fiction, or does it look
more like a textbook?</p>
<p>Only <i>you</i> can decide.</p>
