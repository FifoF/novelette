FOOTNOTES

Novelette is not intended for academic works. It does not support numbered
footnotes with first-line indent.

Popular fiction sometimes does have the occasional footnote. It will be
a comment from the author, or perhaps from a fictional editor. This style
is supported. Reference marks will be literary style (begiining with asterisk),
rather than numbers. The first line of a footnote is not indented.

Syntax for a footnote:

It was a dark and stormy night.\footnote{This chapter is set in Trondheim,
where even the days are dark, in winter.}

If the footnote is written within an opening or display environment,
no reference mark is placed. This is the preferred style.

A footnote may have more than one paragraph of text (unlikely, but possible).
If it does, subsequent paragraphs are indented.

Each opening automatically re-sets the reference mark. In order:
	* † ‡ § ** †† ‡‡ §§
Then the order re-cycles to asterisk.

If the Swainson font is installed (should be, since it comes with Novelette)
then its characters will be used for the reference marks, because they were
specifically designed for this purpose. Does not matter what the main font is.
But if Swainson is not available, the main font will be used.
