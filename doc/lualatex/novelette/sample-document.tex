\init{I}{t was a dark and stormy night.} Lord Withens rode through the gloom,
which is how things usually are, in situations where it is dark and stormy.
Maybe things are different where you are. For example, if you live in
Trondheim, and it is June, the nights are not very dark. Not sure if they
are stormy. But this is not Trondheim.

As he rode through the darkness, Lord Withens thought to himself,
``My, this night is stormy.''
