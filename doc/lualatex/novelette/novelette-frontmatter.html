<h2>Novelette - Design and Content of Front Matter</h2>

<h4>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h4>


<a id="frontmatter"></a>
<div>
<h3>\frontmatter</h3>
<p>This command tells the processor to begin page numbering with lowercase
roman numeral i, and continue as ii, iii, iv, v, ... until the \mainmatter
command is reached.</p>
<p>The absolute minimum frontmatter contains the title page and copyright page.
In practice, minimum frontmatter contains six pages: half-title page,
blank page, title page, copyright page, visual break page, blank page.</p>
<p>Even if the style calls for header and/or footer, it is generally the
case that frontmatter pages do not display either header or footer. The
exception is when something in frontmatter is extended, such as a multi-page
Introduction.</p>
</div>

<a id="frontpages"></a>
<div>
<h3>Content of front matter</h3>
<p>The front matter (or frontmatter) is the portion of your book that precedes
the story. It is "about your book" rather than any part of the story itself.</p>
<p>Front matter must contain a title page and a copyright page. But for a
well-designed book, that is not enough. The contemporary minimum is 6 pages.
Remember that each leaf has 2 pages, odd-numbered recto and even-numbered verso.
So the minimum 6 pages is 3 leaves.</p>
<p>The necessary and optional content of front matter is discussed in detail
on a <a href="novelette-frontmatter.html">separate page</a> of this documentation.</p>
</div>

<a id="aboutcopyright"></a>
<div>
<p>The Copyright page is very important. It will be carefully examined by
robots and humans.</p>
<p>The page must contain: The book title; the book author (possibly pseudonym),
the book copyright year (with true Copyright symbol Â©) and name of copyright
holder (your real name). Some books continue with an elaborate prohibition
against this-and-that, but perhaps "All Rights Reserved" is sufficient;
that is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<p>Under no conditions use "copyleft" or anything implying that you are
being charitable.<p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to provide further information regarding the
use of copyrighted material, public domain material, or trademarks. That is
beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<p>If your book has a library catalog (call) number, put it on the copyright
page. Nowadays, works of popular fiction (especially print-on-demand) do not
need this. If a library wants your book, it will be filed by author surname
in a section with similar books (such as Murder Mysteries) rather than by
call number. If your book becomes a work for the ages, a call number can
be added later.</p>
<p>Provide sufficient information so that the publisher (you) can be
identified and contacted. What you need to provide may vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. It may be as simple as your name, city, nation. The print
service may encourage or discourage providing the URL of your web site.</p>
<p>You cannot imply that the print and distribution service is the publisher,
because it is not.</p>
<p>You cannot be sure that copies of your book will be printed in any
specific location, or using any specific paper or technology, or according
to any particular environmental standard.</p>
<p>Most nations require an "Impressum" or similar declaration that identifies
the actual printer, and place where printed. This may vary from copy to copy.
In books I have sent through print-on-demand in the USA, this information is
printed on the final verso page, added by the machine at time of printing
(which is why the final verso page must be submitted as blank).</p> 
<p>The Copyright page must also show its ISBN (number, not bar code). The only
exception are books that have a small number of private copies, not available
for purchase by others, and not listed in the distribution system.</p>
</div>


<a id="visualbarrier"></a>
<div>
<p>Unless your book has very few pages (glorified pamphlet), something must
come between the Copyright page and the first page of the story. It is
visually distracting to have copyright legalese visible at left, when you
are trying to start a romance or fantasy setting at right.</p>
<p>To create a visual barrier, the simplest practice is to put something
on the recto page facing copyright, with its verso blank. The qiestion is,
what to put on that recto page?</p>
<p>One possibility is a Dedication. Over-used, in my opinion. That's what
web sites are for. If you dedicate the book to Suzy, who subsequently dumps
you, then years later you marry Anna, you don't want Anna nagging you
about Suzy. Thank Suzy on a web page, then when she dumps you, delete it.</p>
<p>Another possibility, under-used but very effective, is an Epigraph.
This is a short item of prose or poetry, intended to set the tone. It could
be pretentious (quoting Shakespeare) or not. Major commercial authors will
sometimes quote each other, because their common publisher fixes it.
But don't you do that. Even if you quote the Bible, be sure that the
translation is in the Public Domain (this is why KJV is widely used).</p>
<p>You can quote imaginary works, or your own book. Perhaps the most famous
Epigraph in modern fiction is the One Ring inscription (Lord of the Rings).</p>
<p>You can use a Table of Contents, if it is short. This is unusual, unless
the book is a collection of short stories.</p>
<p>You can simply repeat the half-title. Even major publishers sometimes
do this.</p>
