<h4>THIS HTML FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ANYTHING MAY CHANGE.</h4>


<p>Document class <i>novelette</i> is unlike any other LaTeX document class:
(a) It requires LuaLaTeX; (b) It does not honor widely-used LaTeX commands;
(c) It has its own methods for setting layout and other properties,
specifically written for those who have very little knowledge of LaTeX;
(d) The resulting PDF is created for printed (to paper) popular fiction,
such as detective novels, printed in black ink only; (e) There is no capability
for Ebooks or any kind of academic works.</p> 

<p>QUICK START: Here is a model Preamble. Each of its commands is a
hyperlink within this documentation. Click to learn what the commands do,
and how to choose their values:</p>

</div>


<a id="lualatex"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX TS-program = lualatex</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". Some GUI programs (TeXworks, TeXstudio, etc.)
can read this line. It tells them to use <i>lualatex</i> compiler, regardless
of what the program uses for its standard compiler.</p>
<p>If you are compiling from command line, be sure to use </i>lualatex</i>.
Anything else will be rejected.</p>
</div>

<a id="utf8"></a>
<div>
<h3>% !TeX encoding = UTF-8</h3>
<p>This is a "magic comment". It tells some GUI programs that the characters
have utf-8 encoding. You must type your document using utf-8, without its
"byte order mark" (BOM). This is essential. It is the default encoding for
Linux and Mac. On Windows, be sure to configure your text editor for
utf-8 without BOM.</p>
</div>

<a id="documentclass"></a>
<div>
<h3>\documentclass{novelette}</h3>
<p>Unlike other LaTeX document classes, Novelette has no class options.
Anything you need is set by one of the other commands in Preamble,
or is automatically calculated from other settings.</p>
<p>The \documentclass begins the Preamble, where you place settings.</p>
</div>

<a id="mode"></a>
<div>
<h3>\mode{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>Novelette has four modes: draft, shade, align, final. If you do not set
the mode, its default is draft.</p>
<p><b>draft</b> disables PDF/X conformance (see <a href="#intent">intent</a>).
It places DRAFT at the top left of each page. The PDF title is changed,
to include the word DRAFT. Otherwise, the layout, line breaks, and page breaks
are the same as they will be, when you graduate to final mode.</p>
<p><b>shade</b> is draft mode, with margins tinted gray.</p>
<p><b>align</b> is shade/draft mode, with text baselines marked.</p>
<p><b>final</b> should only be used when you are ready. In final mode,
Novelette performs some checks that it would otherwise omit (to save time).
If your document fails one of the checks, you will be warned. Then it will
automatically revert to draft mode, so that the failed PDF cannot be confused
with a good final file.</p>
</div>

<a id="intent"></a>
<div>
<h3>\intent{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>There are four intents: none, SWOP, FOGRA39, JC200103. Default is none.
No matter which intent you choose, fonts are subset embedded. That is enough
for some print services.</p>
<p><b>none</b> does not produce PDF/X. No matter how you set intent, it is
automatically changed to <i>none</i> unless you are in final mode. The other
intents produce <span style="white-space:nowrap">PDF/X-1a:2001.</span></p>
<p><b>SWOP</b> means "US Web Coated SWOP". This is most frequently used in
the United States.</p>
<p><b>FOGRA39</b> (actually FOGRA39L) is frequently used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>JC200103</b> is frequently used in Japan.</p>
</div>

<a id="setlang"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setlang{<i>code</i>}[<i>option</i>] <i>-or-</i>\setlang*{<i>code</i>}[<i>option</i>]</h3>
<p>The <i>code</i> is a language code, limited to Western European languages.
The reason for the limitation is that many other world languages require support that
would conflict with Novelette layout methods.</p>
<p>Available codes:<ul>
<li><i>da</i> (Danish)</li>
<li><i>nl</i> (Dutch)</li>
<li><i>is</i> (Icelandic)</li>
<li><i>ga</i> (An Caighdeán Gaelic)</li>
<li><i>nb</i> (Norwegian Bokmål)</li>
<li><i>nn</i> (Norwegian Nynorsk)</li>
<li><i>sv</i> (Swedish)</li>
<li><i>fi</i> (Finnish)</li>
<li><i>pt</i> (Portuguese)</li>
<li><i>es</i> (Spanish)</li>
<li><i>eu</i> (Basque)</li>
<li><i>ca</i> (Catalan)</li>
<li><i>oc</i> (Occitan)</li>
<li><i>fr</i> (French, France)</li>
<li><i>fr-CH</i> (French, Swiss)</li>
<li><i>de</i> (German, Germany/Austria)</li>
<li><i>de-CH</i> (German, Swiss)</li>
<li><i>it</i> (Italian)</li>
<li><i>en</i> (English, British)</li>
<li><i>en-US</i> (English, USA)</li>
<li><i>xx</i> (No hyphenation).</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For most languages, there is no difference between the unstarred <i>\setlang</i>
and the starred <i>\setlang*</i> commands. Exceptions:</p>
<p>In German (de), the unstarred command uses contemporary <span style="whitespace:no-wrap">(post-1996)</span> rules.
The starred command uses older (1901) rules.</p>
<p>In French <span style="whitespace:no-wrap">(fr and fr-CH)</span> the
unstarred command adds extra space before the semicolon,
exclamation, and question marks. French
<span style="whitespace:no-wrap">(fr, but not fr-CH)</span> also adds space before
the colon. Both <span style="whitespace:nowrap">(fr and fr-CH)</span> add space
after opening guillemet, and before
closing guillemet. The starred command does not add any of these spaces; this is useful
if you are importing text that already has space characters there.</p>
<p>There is only one option <i>[-g]</i> and it is only effective for French
<span style="whitespace:no-wrap">(fr and fr-CH).</span>
It does not add guillemet space, regardless of starred or unstarred command.</p>
<p>The setting does not perform spelling or grammar check, does not style time or date,
and does not suggest words. You must do that yourself.</p>
</div>

<a id="title"></a>
<div>
<h3>\title{<i>Title of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>When you use a print-on-demand service, you provide them with metadata
for your book: title, author, genre, keywords, description, ISBN, and maybe
others. Of these, only title and author are part of the PDF. This is because
the PDF itself is not being marketed. Information such as the copyright
and ISBN appear in print.</p>
<p>The <i>\title</i> of your document must be exactly the same as whatever
you provided to the service. Do not use TeX macros, styles, or character codes
(except as listed below). Use straight (ordinary keyboard) apostrophe,
not curly. You may use Latin-1 letters with diacriticals.</p>
<p>Exceptions: Special characters \# \$ \% \& \{ \}
are preceded by a backslash, as shown.</p>
<p>Example: \title{The \$20 Balloon}</p>
<p>Note: The print service may allow you to use non-alphanumeric characters
in the title, or may forbid them. It is a matter of how things are indexed
in their database. Novelette does not care.</p>
</div>

<a id="author"></a>
<div>
<h3>\author{<i>Author of Your Book</i>}</h3>
<p>The considerations for <i>\title</i> apply, with these additional:</p>
<p>Novelette is not intended for academic works. There should be a single
author (in some cases, two equal authors, using a single <i>\author</i>).</p>
<p>Whether the author is your real name, or a pseudonym, is up to you.
If in doubt, ask the print service.</p>
<p>If you use a pseudonym, then you should probably use your real name as
copyright holder, on the copyright page. Then, if someone unlawfully copies
your book, it will be easier to enforce the copyright. Otherwise, you will
have to prove that "Fakename Author" is actually "Realname You" before
distributors will honor your requests.</p>
<p>And, if you do use a pseudonym, request that distributors (and libraries)
have it indexed under the desired name (pseudonym or real name).</p>
</div>

<a id="trimsize"></a>
<div>
<h3>\trimsize{width=<i>size</i>,height=<i>size</i>}</h3>
<p>Trim Size is the size of your book pages. Be sure to choose cream paper
(creme, off-white), not white paper. The print service will offer a choice
of several standard sizes.</p>
<p>Dimensions are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm).
Examples:<p>
<p>\trimsize{width=5.5in,height=8.5in} % American Digest.</p>
<p>\trimsize{width=129mm,height=198mm} % British B-Format.</p>
<p>The name "trim size" comes from the manufacturing process. The pages are
printed on larger paper, then roughly cut and assembled with glue.
The cover is attached with glue, then the entire book is "trimmed" with
a cutting device. This is why such books have all page edges aligned.</p>
<p>In the case of library hardcover books, trim size refers to the interior
pages. The cover size is slightly larger.</p>
</div>

<a id="sheetfeed"></a>
<div>
<h3>\sheetfeed{<i>choice</i>}</h3>
<p>Do not use the \sheetfeed setting, unless you are certain that you need it.
If you use this setting incorrectly, big problems will result. Do not guess.
Available choices are <i>letter</i> and <i>A4</i>.</p>
<p>If you do not use \sheetfeed, the PDF page size will be the same as the
book trim size. This is how nearly all print-on-demand services want it.</p>
<p><b>letter</b> centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally, in the
larger USletter size (8.5in width, 11in height),</p>
<p><b>A4</b> (or a4) centers the trim size, vertically and horizontally,
in the larger European A4 size (210mm width, 297mm height).</p>
<p>If you are printing pages at home, for manual editing, then you might
use letter or A4, to produce consistent results from your home printer.
That might also be the case, if your book will be reviewed by an editor.</p>
<p>Novelette does not produce crop marks or trim marks. It does write the
internal "TrimBox" metadata to the PDF.</p>
</div>

<a id="margins"></a>
<div>
<h3>\margins{top=<i>size</i>,outside=<i>size</i>,bottom=<i>size</i>,inside=<i>size</i>}</h3>
<p>In Novelette, margins surround the printable area. Nothing may be printed
within the margins. The header, main text, and footer all must fit within the
rectangle surrounded by the margins. This is how the term "margins" is used
by most print services.</p>
<p>Word processors usually place header within the top margin, and footer
within the bottom margin.</p>
<p>Margins are measured in units of inches or millimeters (in,mm). It is best
to use the same units for margins, as you use for trim size.</p>
<p><b>top</b> margin is the area above the topmost printable item, which
is the header (if your page style uses header), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>outside</b> margin is the area at the outer page edge, being the left
side of even-numbered (verso) pages, or the right side of odd-numbered (recto)
pages.</p>
<p><b>bottom</b> margin is the area below the lowest printable item, which
is the footer (if your page layout uses footer), or main text (if otherwise).</p>
<p><b>inside</b> margin as at the spine (binding). In general, this margin
should be set 0.125in (or 3mm) wider than the ouside margin. The extra width
allows for binding glue.</p>
<p>You may abbreviate the margins setting, with a single value:<br>
\margins{<i>size</i>} sets top, ouside, and bottom margins to that size.
Inside margin is set 0.125in (or 3mm) larger.</p>
<p>If you do not set margins, Novelette will set them for you. At smaller
trim sizes, the margins will be at the minimum required by some print services.
At larger trim size, the margins will be larger.</p>
</div>


<a id="layout"></a>
<div>
<h3>\layout{<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>,<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>}</h3>
<p>The \layout command accepts one or more comma-separated key=value pairs.
It sets the page layout header/footer style.</p>
<p><b>style=<i>integer</i></b><br>Integer from 1 to 7 selects page style,
(header and/or footer) from a menu of available styles. The default style
depends on other page design settings.</p>
<p><b>gap=<i>number</i></b><br>Number is integer|decimal from 0 to 1.
Value 0 (rarely used) places header|footer at the line immediately above|below
 main text. Value 1 skips a whole line between them, and is best for
large books. Value 0.5 is a nice compromise for smaller books.</p>
<p><b>scale=<i>number</i></b><br>
Sets the scale of header/footer text, relative to size of main font.
Acceptable range is 0.75 to 1, but must evaluate to at least 7bp.</p>
<p>Note: If you use a header/footer, there will be pages where nothing
is printed in the header/footer. Nevertheless, the space for header/footer
is reserved; main text does not vertically expand to fill the empty
header/footer.<p>
<p>Note: Command <a href="#thispagestyle">\thispagestyle</a> locally changes
the layout for a single page.</p>
</div>


<a id="text"></a>
<div>
<h3>\text{<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>,<i>key</i>=<i>value</i>}</h3>
<p>The \text command accepts one or more comma-separated key=value pairs.</p>
<p><b>fontsize=<i>size</i></b><br>Sets the size of main text font. Integer
or decimal. Typical value near 11.5pt. Must have units pt (TeX points) or
bp (PostScript points).</p>
<p><b>lines=<i>integer</i></b><br>Number of lines in main text block, not
counting header or footer. The default number depends on page sizes.</p>
</div>


<a id="setfont"></a>
<div>
<h3>\setfont{<i>role</i>}{<i>Font Name</i>}[<i>features</i>]</h3>
<p>Novelette uses <i>fontspec</i> technology for Open Type fonts. If you are
a knowledgeable LaTeX user, you may use some aspects of <i>fontspec</i>
directly, but that is strongly discouraged, due to potential layout conflict.
Do not use <i>\setmainfont</i>.</p>
<p><i>\setfont</i> has two mandatory arguments, and an optional argument.</p>
<p><b>role</b> is a keyword, one of: <i>main deco</i>.
It assigns the font to its proper place and purpose.</p>
<p><b>Font Name</b> is the Open Type font family name. Examples are
EB Garamond, Libertinus Serif. No TeX fonts with three-letter codes.</p>
<p><b>features</b> is an optional, comma-separated list of Open Type features,
using <i>fontspec</i> syntax. Default uses kerning and OldStyle numerals.
Default also uses TeX ligatures (converts `` to “ and so forth).</p>
<p>Common ligatures (ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl) are not enabled by default, since
they are not necessarily useful. To enable common ligatures, write
<span style="white-space:nowrap">[Ligatures=Common]</span> option.</p>
</div>


<a id="guides"></a>
<div>
<h3>\guides{integer,integer,integer,integer}</h3>
<p>You may create four or fewer pairs of guides. These are marks in the
side margins, when in shade or align mode. The guides align with main text
baseline and descender, at the integer line number from top of main text.</p>
<p>Guides are not enforced. They are merely for your own use. Typically,
a guide is placed where you wish the topmost item in openings to sit, and
another guide is placed at the first line of main text under the opening.</p>
<p>If you use guides, they will be the same on every page.</p>
</div>

<a id="begindoc"></a>
<div>
<h3>\begin{document}</h3>
<p>This command is the boundary between the Preamble above it, and the
printable book below it.</p>
<p>If you ever get an error message "Missing \begin{document}" and wonder why,
it means that you made a syntax error somewhere in the Preamble.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> TeX has many characters, or character combinations,
that have special meaning. What you type is not what you get in print.</p>
<p>After \begin{document}, Novelette reduces the number of special characters,
to reduce the chance that you will become tanlged with special meanings.
This is <a href="#specialcharbody">explained in detail</a>.</p>
</div>


<a id="whichfonts"></a>
<div>
<h3>Which Fonts to Use?</h3>
<P>You may use any free, shareware, or commercial OpenType font. There is
no need to limit yourself to fonts from the LaTeX font catalog. In fact,
many LaTeX fonts are not available as OpenType.</p>
<p>Many, but not all, TrueType fonts are also OpenType, in this context.
However, Novelette cannot handle TrueType "collections" bound into a single
file.</p>
<p>Desirable fonts for fiction will often say that they are similar to
Garamond, Caslon, or Bembo. Some are more similar than others, but that
is not relevant. Such fonts are designed for casual reading, where the eye
will not dwell on a particular item of interest.</p>
<p>Fonts such as Times (New) Roman, and the TeX Latin Modern Roman,
do not perform as well in fiction. Times was designed for relatively crowded
newsprint. LMR was designed for academic papers.</p>
<p>Print-on-demand technology uses high-speed photocopy or inkjet machines.
The text will not be as dark as traditional offset presses (although at
least one service offers "premium black ink", whatever that is). So, be sure
that you are not using overly slender fonts. If your pages do not look
good when you print the PDF in a photocopier, then they probably will not
look better when bound into a book.</p>
<p>Be sure that your fonts are properly licensed for commercial use, and be
sure that use of the fonts does not obligate you to give away the source
code or finished PDF, or the printed book. Fonts with the "GPL" (GNU Public
License) cannot be used, unless they also bear a "font exception" releasing
you from some of the GPL terms. Beware of free fonts that do not have
enough information (such as Copyright) to ascertain the creator. Copyright
is good, as long as you have the license you need. One well-known free
license is the "SIL Open Font License" (OFL). There are others. Or, pay
for the license of commercial or shareware fonts.</p>
<p>Among LaTeX OpenType fonts, EB Garamond and Libertinus Serif are probably
good enough. There are others. EBG is slightly light, and LS is slightly
upright.</p>
