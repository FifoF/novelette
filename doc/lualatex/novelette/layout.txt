LAYOUT

\trimsize{width=W,height=H}
	W and H are measured in units of in or mm.

\margins{top=T,outside=O,bottom=B,inside=I}
	T, O, B, I are measured in units of in or mm.
	Inside means at the spine (binding). Usually larger than the others.

\design{fontsize=M,lines=L,style=S,headgap=H,footgap=F}
	M is the main font size, with units pt|bp.
	L is integer lines per page, main body text (not counting header/footer).
	S is integer style number, which sets whether running-body pages
have header/footer/both, and the position of items in the header.
	H and F adjust the vertical space between header/body and body/footer.

Note that Novelette does not have a setting for leading (baseline skip).
It is calculated from other settings.

There are a few other settings that serve special purposes (TO DO).
