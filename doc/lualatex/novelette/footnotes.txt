FOOTNOTES

Novelette is not intended for academic works. It does not support numbered
footnotes with first-line indent.

Popular fiction sometimes has an occasional footnote. It will be
a comment from the author, or perhaps from a fictional editor. This style
is supported. Reference marks will be literary style (beginning with asterisk),
rather than numbers. The first line of a footnote is not indented.

Syntax for a footnote:

It was a dark and stormy night.\footnote{This chapter is set in Trondheim,
where even the days are dark, in winter.}

If the footnote is written within an opening or display environment,
no reference mark is placed. This is the preferred style.

A footnote may have more than one paragraph of text (unlikely, but possible).
If it does, subsequent paragraphs are indented.

Each opening automatically re-sets the reference mark. In order:
	* † ‡ § ** †† ‡‡ §§
Then the order re-cycles to asterisk.
