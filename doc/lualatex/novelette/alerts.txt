LOG ALERTS

Novelette regards a few things as being suspicious. They are not errors,
not even warnings. But there is the possibility that what you wrote was not
what you meant. These get an ALERT message in the log file.

If there are one or more ALERT messages, you may throw a warning, or not.
This is chosen by \warnalert or \nowarnalert in Preamble. Default \warnalert.
Note that only one such warning is thrown, no matter how many ALERTs.
	Programs such as TeXworks can observer whether or not a warning is thrown,
but have no knowledge of ALERT. It is best to allow \warnalert until you are
sure that any remaining ALERTs are harmless.
	If you allow remaining ALERTs, then use \nowarnalert in final mode.
Otherwise, \warnalert may interfere with final mode.

These cause an ALERT each time they are written in the document body:
	1. Novelette has no document class options. If you write something there,
other than an integer, it will be ignored, and cause an ALERT.
	2. You may straight double quotes for diaeresis (umlaut) , such as \"o
for รถ. Any other usage will print the straight double quotes, not curly,
and will throw an ALERT. There are no babel shortcuts. Writing "HHHH (where
each H is a hex digit) will not produce a Unicode character. But you may use
\uni{HHHH} instead.
	3. Writing \% simply prints the percent symbol (as usual). If you write
% without a backslash in front, it will (as usual) start a comment, and also
throw an ALERT. Instead of using % for comments, use \memo{text}. However,
\memo can only be used between paragraphs.
	4. Settings that are unusually large or small may throw an ALERT.
