FONTS

Novelette uses only utf-8 character encoding. Fonts are handled by the
fontspec package, which is loaded automatically.

There are several pre-defined fonts, created by the \setfont command:
	\setfont{main}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{head}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{name}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{desc}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{note}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{deco}{font name}[font features]
	\setfont{alt}{font name}[font features]
Note that the optional argument [font features] comes at the end.

You must use Open Type fonts, or in some cases TrueType fonts. Never use the
older TeX Type 1 fonts, or any other technology.

If you do not set the main font yourself, Novelette will look for EB Garamond,
Swainson, or Libertinus Serif. If none are found, it will use Latin Modern
Roman as last resort.

If you do not set one or more of the other fonts, it will be a variation
of the main font.

You may also use fontspec commands to define your own fonts. But in most cases,
this is unnecessary.

The main font is used for the body of your text.

The head font is used for headers and footers. If you do not set it yourself,
it will be the main font, but at slightly smaller scale, and slightly looser
tracking (letter spacing).

The name font is used for the name of an "opening" page. An example would
be chapter numbers, Introduction, Prologue, or similar purposes.
If you do not set the name font yourself, the main font will be used,
but at about 1.8x its normal size.

The desc (description) font is also used on an "opening" page, if you need
to provide a few words under the name. For example, the name of a chapter
might simply be the numeral 4, and its description might be At Yorktown.
If you do not set the desc font yourself, the name font will be used,
but at about 1.33x its normal size.

The note font is used for footnotes, and for "legalese" passages.
It should always be smaller than the main font. If your do not set the note
font yourself, the main font will be used, but at about 0.88x normal size.
It is usually best to allow the default.

Not every book will need a deco font. It is intended for something unusual,
to provide dingbats or special characters. If you do not set the deco font
yourself, it will be the same as the main font.

Not every book will need an alt font. It might be useful if your main font
has a limited character set, and you need to occasionally insert another
character, which is provided by the alt font. If you do not set the alt font
yourself, then the main font will be used.

Novelette does not use sans-serif, monospace, or math fonts. If you use
TeX commands for that purpose, the result is unpredictable. Of course,
you could use almost any font for head, name, desc, or deco fonts.
