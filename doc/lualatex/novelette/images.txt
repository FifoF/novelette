IMAGES

As of mid-March 2023, Novelette is in testing mode.

The \image command will be used to place images. It has been tested and works,
but more needs to be done.

Do not use images yet.



Novelette does not use \includegraphics or any other standard TeX command
for image placement. It uses a custom \image command:
	\image[placement]{filename.png}
The placement is at most one of (clr), at most one of (ntbi):
	c -> horizontally centered (except inline)
	l -> left-aligned (except inline)
	r -> right-aligned (except inline)
	n -> no-float
	t -> top-float
	b -> bottom-float
	i -> inline
If an image is inline, its size is limited, and any other placement is ignored.
Only an inline image may be placed within a paragraph. All other placements
must be between paragraphs.
	Default horizontal placement is centered, except in an opening, where the
default placement agrees with the opening.
	Default vertical placement is no-float. The image will be placed where you
write the \image command. If it cannot fit on that page, it will move to
the next page, possibly leaving blank lines behind it. Unless that is what
you want, you should fix placement using top-float or bottom-float.
	Experienced TeX users: Notice that there is no "h" (here) placement.
There is a fundamental difference between the way TeX calculates position,
when it places the image "here" or floats is somewhere else. There is no easy
way to maintin the line grid, without re-defining TeX floats. So if you need
"here", begin with no-float, then manually change to top-float (or bottom)
as necessary.


ICONS
	In Novelette, an "icon" is a small image placed inline with text.
It must conform to all other image requirements. In addition, its height
is limited. The limit is less than or equal to 1.2 x typesize.
	For example, at 600px/in, with typesize 11.4pt (72.27 TeX pt/in),
an icon cannot exceed 113 pixels height. The value may be slightly less,
depending on other factors. The exact limit will be shown in the log Summary,
which will also show where the surrounding text baseline will be positioned
relative to the icon bottom.
