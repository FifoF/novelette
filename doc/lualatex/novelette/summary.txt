SUMMARY IN LOG FILE

After a document successfully creates its PDF, the log file will contain
a summary, near the end of the file. This summary is custom to Novelette.

The summary shows all the settings that were actually used. Some of them are
your own settings. Some of them are defaults (which are calculated from other
settings).

In a few cases, you may see that Novelette used a setting that is different
from what you requested. That means your request could not be honored,
so it was automatically tweaked to something possible. In most cases,
you should re-write your settings so that they agree with the summary.

When your work is at or near final, be sure to save its summary. That will
help you re-compile the document, in the event that you move to a different
TeX system.
