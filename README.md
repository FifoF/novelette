Simplified LuaLaTeX Document Class for Popular Fiction

Novelette is the younger, smaller sibling to the existing Novel document class.
It is faster, more accurate, and simpler to use. It achieves this by limiting
available setings and macros to only those that are absolutely necessary for
print-to-paper popular fiction. No frills, but my public library is full of
books that are well within the capability of Novelette.

This is a work in progress, as of late February 2023. The main features have
been tested, but are still subject to change. Thus, no documentation yet.
Power users can get a glimpse of what Novelette will do, by looking into
the code.

Expected release mid-April 2023. Before I release it, I must wait for
2023 binaries on my platform. They are custom-built, beyond my control.

Update: April 19, 2023: Almost ready for beta testing. At this point, there are
"no known bugs" and the command set is reasonably stable. Might do some
under-the-hood modifications, or not. Working on the documentation,
so there are places where the docs are incomplete or incorrect.
Testing welcome! Still waiting for 2023 binaries.
