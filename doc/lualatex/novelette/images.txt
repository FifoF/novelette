IMAGES


IMAGE COMMAND

Novelette does not use \includegraphics or any other standard TeX command
for image insertion. It uses a custom \image command:
	\image[placement]{filename.png}
Bottom of image is at text baseline.

The placement may contain at most one of l,c,r,o,i for horizontal alignment.
Default is c, except in the opening environment, where the default may be
set by the \openings command in Preamble.
	l -> left-aligned
	c -> horizontally centered
	r -> right-aligned
	o -> outside aligned (left of verso, right of recto)
	i -> inside aligned (right of verso, left of recto)

The placement may contain at most one of h,t,b,p for insertion relative to
the flow of main text. These are "similar but different" to standard LaTeX
float definitions.
	h -> Place image "here" where the \image command is written, anywhere on
		 the page. But if it cannot fit, move it to the top of the following
		 page. Main text will flow to fill the lines left behind.
		 If you do not wish text to flow, use \clearpage to break pages.
	t -> Place image at "top" of the page where command is written, which
		 is usually above the command. In some cases, if the command is too
		 late, or if other material is at the top, then the image is moved
		 to the top of the following page.
	b -> Place image at "bottom" of the page where command is written.
		 If it cannot fit there, place it at bottom of following page.
	p -> Place image on a page by itself.
The \image command must occupy its own paragraph. The bottom of the image
will be at text baseline.
	Novelette only adds enough whitespace, above or below an image,
to maintain the text line grid. If you need more whitespace, you may insert
the \null command above|below the image, to create blank lines. Or, recreate
the image with its own whitespace included.
	There is no capability for a border. If you need one, draw it within the
image itself.
	There is no caption command. If necessary, simply write a line of text.
A better approach is to draw the text within the image itself. Beware of
using fine-detail fonts within low-resolution images.


FAKE IMAGE

Write first, do graphics later! Novelette allows you to place fake images.
Fake images may not be used in final mode: an error results.
	\image[placement]{integer}
The \image command accepts an integer instead of a filename.
It will place a gray rectangle occupying that many lines height. Width is
half the text width.
	Look in the log Summary, to see what actual image sizes are needed.
