LANGUAGE

Important: Other document classes use different methods for specifying
language. Disregard anything you read elsewhere!

Novelette uses this command in Preamble:
	\setlang{code}
Notice that it is NOT \setlanguage.

There is a limited list of available codes. You may use only one.
The code is case-sensitive!
	If you do not use \setlang, a default hyphenation pattern will be used.
If you attempt to set more than one language, only the last valid setting
will be used. If no valid setting, the default will be used.
	Do not use any codes but these. \setlang{english} is wrong.

Many languages are pronounced differently, in different regions. Some have
differing choices of vocabulary. But Novelette language is only concerned
with hyphenation patterms, which are generally the same despite regions.

French writers beware: Novelette can automatically add extra space between
sentences. But it does NOT automatically add punctuation spaces.
You will have to type those spaces yourself.

Any language: The title of your book, and author name, must be in the
Latin-1 character set.

Novelette does not care what you write. If you use \setlang{fr} but then
write the entire book in German, no complaint. But your German will be
hyphenated according to French rules.

You cannot load the `lipsum' package. If you need some text for
testing layout, the built-in \fillertext command may be used in the
document body.
