<h2>Writing Tools</h2>
<p class="noindent">How to write your book? Should you use a word processor?
A plain text editor? One of the TeX GUI (graphical user interface)
programs?</p>
<p>The answer is NOT "anything". Some choices are better than others.</p>


<a id="wordprocessor"></id>
<div>
<h3>Word Processors</h3>
<p>Your best choice is probably a word processor. Reason: Such programs
usually have built-in spelling check, and can subtitute smart quotes
(curly instead of straight). If you are a good typist, this will help
you write quickly, instead of being bogged down by TeX code. You can
add the TeX code later.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do write any TeX code, it will be flagged as mis-spelled.
So it is better to turn off automatic spelling correction.</li>
<li>How you set page size, margins, text size, font name, or anything else,
is irrelevant. That information will not be transferred to TeX.</li>
<li>Do not use headers or footers. The method used by a word processor
is very different from the method used by TeX.</li>
<li>TeX separates paragraphs with a blank line. Alternatively,
<code>\par</code> ends a paragraph. The word processor may begin a new
paragraph whenever you hit Enter, and indent whatever follows. Those indents
will be ignored by TeX. The best way to ensure correct paragraphs,
is to separate them with a blank line.</li>
<li>Text styling, such as Italics, must not be used. You will need to write
TeX markup later.</li>
<li>Your text must be exported as "plain text" in utf-8 encoding, without BOM
(byte order mark). Ensure that it does not add headers or page numbers.</li>
<li>If you cannot do all of the above, then do not use a word processor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plain Text Editors</h3>
<p>A plain text editor is exactly that. What you type is what it saves.
Some plain text editors are enhanced with spell check. Some are enhanced
with syntax highlighting, which colors the code markup.</p>
<p>Be sure that the plain text editor saves (or exports) its work in utf-8
encoding, without BOM. This is the standard on Linux devices. On Windows,
you may need to check the program settings. Under no circumstances use
Windows Notepad. The free program Notepad++ is popular for Windows.</p>
<p>Do not enable automatic code completion. Since Novelette has many
commands that differ from ordinary LaTeX, the result may be incorrect.</p>
<p>The developer of Novelette uses the "nano" plain text editor, on Linux.
Spelling check, via a word processor, is done later. Final TeX markup
is in nano or TeXworks (see below).</p>

<a id="gui"></a>
<div>
<h3>TeX GUI Programs</h3>
<p>There are several programs that provide a graphical interface for TeX
documents. Typically, they provide a TeX-oriented menu, a pane or tab
where you can write plain text, and another pane or tab where you can
view the resulting PDF (after build, not in real time).</p>
<p>However, most of these programs were created for writing mathematical
expressions. Their menu choices are irrelevant to popular fiction. Worse,
they may offer to insert TeX commands that will fail in Novelette.
So, do not use those programs.</p>
<p>The exception is TeXworks. It comes with MiKTeX, and is available on
most Linux platforms. Its minimal interface does what you need to do,
without offering features that you cannot use. You may be able to add
spell-check. If you like TeXworks, use it.</p>
<p>The developer of Novelette is very insistent on having paragraphs,
and page breaks, just where they are best-suited to the text. After the
writing and markup is tentatively finished, the files are loaded into
TeXworks. Where necessary, paragraphs are individually edited. This is
the advantage of original fiction; anything can be re-written with more or
fewer words.</p>
