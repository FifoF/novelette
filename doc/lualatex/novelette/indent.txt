INDENTS

Novelette automatically indents the first line of each paragraph, with these
exceptions: Within centered text, or within an opening environment (no matter
how it is aligned), no indent. Immediately following an opening environment,
the first line of main text is not indented.

The normal indent is 1.5em. This "looks ok."

Commands \noindent and \indent can (usually) change this behavior, if written
at the beginning a a paragraph.

Under some circumstances, LaTeX does not obey \indent or \noindent.
You can over-rule LaTex with \forceindent and \backindent. All these do is
insert (or backtrack) a horizontal space. You may use more than one of them.

If you wish to block indent an entire paragraph, use an environment:
pushleft, pushright, pushcenter. The default indent is the normal indent.
You may multiply by an integer value, as optional argument. Example:
	\begin{pushright} % Push right means indent at left.
	This block of text is indented by one normal indent, at its left.\par
	You may use more than one paragraph. In each paragraph, its first line
	of text may or may not be further indented, relative to the block.
	That can be fixed using the commands shown above.\par
	\end{pushright}
	\begin{pushcenter}[2]
    This block of text is indented by two normal indents, at both sides.\par
	You may use more than one paragraph. The first lines may be further
	intented. Note that this is not the same as centered text.\par
	The pushcenter environment is especially well-suited to poetry,
	if you are so inclined.\par
	\end{pushcenter}

Technical note: LaTeX has other methods for block indent. They use more code,
because they must allow for various package possibilities. Since Novelette
does not permit loading extra packages, lengthy code is unnecessary.
