OPENINGS

An "opening" is a page with special layout. New chapters begin with an opening.
Certain chapter-like portions, such as Introduction or Prologue, may use
the opening style.

\begin{opening}
\name{such as chapter number}
\desc{if used, a very short description}
\end{opening}
Main text starts here.

Command \begin{opening} begins a new page. If your page style uses headers,
there will be no header on that page.

Commands \name and \desc may only be used within the opening. They will
style the text according to \setfont{name} and \setfont{desc}.

In the Preamble, you may use this command (note plural openings):
	\openings{top=T,height=H,align=A} %%%%% revise
T and H are integers, lines of text. T defines where you normally will place
the topmostitem in the opening (usually the name) H defines the height of
the opening before main text begins. A is left|center|right, and determines
how name and desc are placed.
	Novelette does not enforce T or H. Instead, when you work in shade mode,
it places markers at T and H. Then you can manually adjust vertical positions.

The first line of main text may have special styling. A common practice is
to enlarge the first letter, and put a few words in small caps.
If you wish to do this, use the \init command:
	\init[option]{letter}{words} then ordinary text follows.
The letter is the first letter (sometimes also an opening quotation mark).
The words are placed in small caps. Be sure that the letter is not duplicated
at the start of the words.
	The option is a small number, which adjusts kerning between the letter
and the next character. For example, if the letter is T, you may be able to
place the following letter so that it partially moves under the arm of the T.
A negative number moves things closer. Typical value might be 0.2.
	The enlarged first letter does not push its line downward.

There are no drop caps. Just forget about them.
