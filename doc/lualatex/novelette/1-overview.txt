OVERVIEW

Novelette is a lualatex document class, specifically intended for
popular fiction, especially using print-on-demand TO PAPER technology.
It has no capability for Ebooks, and never will.

Unlike most other document classes, Novelette is pre-configured for
the most frequently used size and style of P.O.D. popular fiction.
If that is not what you need, the various settings have understandable
names and values.

There are not a lot of possible settings. There are not a lot of possible
automations. Novelette keeps you focused on writing your book,
not on difficult TeX code.

And ... [pause for dramatic effect] ... Novelette does not have math.
You weren't going to put math in your fiction book, were you?

The existing "Novel" document class (from 2018) was successfully used
for printed fiction, by several authors. But it has much more capability
than is really needed, and thus has a learning curve. The Novelette class
has only what is necessary to produce every murder mystery, sci-fi, and
adventure novel that I see on the public library shelves. You would be
amazed at how little is needed, and how easy it is to learn (if you already
have a working TeX system).
