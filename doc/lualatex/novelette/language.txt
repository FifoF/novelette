LANGUAGE

Novelette is intended for popular fiction, often print-on-demand, in
American and possibly British markets. For this reason, the choice of
language is very limited.

Command \setlang allows you to choose at most one of:
	English english American american British british
The default English/english is American.

You may also choose at most one of:
	Spanish spanish

If you do not use \setlang, default is American (English).

The language does not load babel or polyglossia. All it does is load
hyphenation patterns (if installed) for the requested language.
In the case of American, the patterns are "usenglishmax".

If you request the lipsum package, then latin hyphenation (if available)
is automatically loaded, not by using \setlang.

If you set English but write in French, Novelette will not complain.
But your French will be hyphenated according to English rules, and you
will not obtain punctuation spacing unless you type it manually.
