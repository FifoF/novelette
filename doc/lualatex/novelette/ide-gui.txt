IDE or GUI ?

Should you use a GUI program to process your Novelette Document?
Probably not!

When you are writing your book, it is best to use a word processor that
will automatically provide smart quotes, and allow you to check spelling.
Just be careful that it does not perform inappropriate substitutions.
Then, export the text as utf-8 plain text, without BOM (byte order mark).

Usually, it is best to change the file extension to *.tex rather than *txt.
In some operating systems, this will show the TeX icon for the file.

To process your filename.tex use command line:

	lualatex filename.tex

If you wish to use a GUI program, use TeXworks. Avoid the fancier programs
such as TeXStudio and such. The fancier programs are cluttered with math
features that you cannot use, and may even misunderstand your document,
because it is not a known (to them) document class.

Depending on your operating system, and your PDF viewer software, you may
be able to edit your document, compile it, and view the updated result,
without needing to close and re-open the PDF viewer.
